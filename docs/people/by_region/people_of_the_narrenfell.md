# People of Narrenfell
The [Narr](/geography/realms/narrenfell) are honorable, traditionalist people, with deep roots in their historic ideals and naturalist philosophy.  During the [Age of Stone](/history/ages/age_of_stone), they were heavily influenced by the Dwarven settlers, embracing the progress they brought and feeling kinship with their moral ethos.

New settlements form rarely in this land, where most regard nature before riches and many villages stay small.

These days, adventurers from all over flock to the uncharted plains. Many also choose to retire in the easy going life of the isolated communities.

## Lifestyle
All Narr have a close relationship with nature and ths is evident in their lifestyle, yet are still very mush at home in urban society.  Their love for nature serves as an ethos when dealing with each other and outsiders, which becomes even more evident when they build and expand their settlements.

Industry serves progress, but not at the cost of nature.  Urbanization brings affluence through trade and knowledge through discourse, but not at the cost of tradition and self worth.

Farming, and hunting are seen as noble professions, as it measures the men by the sweat of their brow - a challenging and worthy ideal.  People also hunt for sport, as they have for many generations, but care is taken as to not taking too much, leaving the land bare.

# Settlements
Most of the major settlements are quite modernized and civilized, especially those located on key trade routes.  But for the most part, the vast expanse of rolling savannah hills are untouched and verdant.

Small villages are scattered across the wilderness, where the land shows why it was historically known as the _Barbarian Kingdom_.

## Leadership & Nobility
Stemming from historical traditions, the Narrenfell is _**guided**_ (rather than ruled) by a Triad of leaders from the major cities in the region.  They are known as _Sebi_ ^chiefs^, who reside in the three capitals of the region: **Sceptre's Hall** in the West, **Port Mere** in the South, and Eskold in the North.  These leaders meet annually to discuss trade and management of the realm, each with their own counsellors.

The _Sebis'_ authority are recognized by all and generally considered absolute, but no single settlement (apart from the capital cities) owe any direct allegiance to them.  For the most part, settlements govern themselves in a state-like fashion, and entertain a pseudo-federal-like relationship to the Triad states.

For the most part, leadership runs in bloodlines (especially the _Sebi_), but anyone who proves themselves worthy can be elected as a leader if they so choose.  Counselors are almost always chosen by the people.

## Ideology & Philosophy:
A purposeful life for the Narr is one of virtue.  They hold fast to many old traditions of honour, balance and honesty.

However there is an unusual duality in their morality, being true to the law of nature before the law of the realm.  For example, vengeance for a proven wrongdoing is seen as a better outcome than a lengthy trial in the courts.  People are presumed innocent until proven guilty though, stemming the tide of bodies from justice killings.

To the people, life has purpose, and in that, a purposeful death is one of honour.  They believe that what you leave behind is more important than what you achieve in life for yourself. 

## Cultural Images:
Animals play an important role in society -  as spirits of guidance and examples of wisdom.  Even those who have fully embraced a secular living, still revere the old folklore and keep totems as important moral reminders.  Fables are used to teach their children the importance of honour and honesty.

## Sayings:
> “When you show respect for living things, they will show respect for you.”

>“A man can be a wolf or a bear in his mind, and then let his body follow”

## Historic Influences
During the [Age of Stone](/history/ages/age_of_stone), the Dwarves migrated into the region in search of precious resources.  They built cities, and brought their ideas of nobility to the local barbarian tribes.  The locals were peaceful and friendly to the settlers and quickly mingled with the newcomers, as they shared similar beliefs of honour and virtue.  They adopted a variant of the Dwarven class system as their own, and lived side by side with the Dwarven expansionists.

The Dwarves in turn respected the rule of nature, and their settlements did not over-spend the natural resources.
