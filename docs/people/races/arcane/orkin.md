# Orkin

> It is still hard to define the Orkin and their various subspecies. They are most often seen as primitive, bullheaded and uneducated. But as with most things, there are many subtleties to their culture and appearances, that warrant additional study by the anthropologist.

## Description
Orkin are larger than most of the Malkovian species. Most notably, they tend to have a brutish apprearance with low brows, deep-set eyes and very pronounces canines that resemble boar tusks.  Their skin varies, as other Native Races, from light browns to earthy greens, reds or blues, most probably an adaption to suit the natural tones of their claimed habitats.

### Subraces

## History
The origin of all the Malkovian races (Orkin, Goblins, Ogres) is in [Gaia](../../../cosmology/planes/gaia.md). Though there still remains many of The Blood of Malkov withing Gaia, those who migrated to Aklatoria have lost their native connection to the Echo Plane's cosmology. Mythologically, it is believed the Migration happened as part of the fallout following the [Black Seeding](../../../history/myths/black_seeding.md).
