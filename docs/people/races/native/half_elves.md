# Half-Elves

> The Half-Elf physique resembles that of the Elf, most notably their pointy ears and sharp features, though to say that its the rule of the union would be irresponsible a claim. A child retains much of both parents, and physique differ vastly depending on the choice of partner. </br>

While Elves are generally regarded as stoical, they are not at all prejudiced toward physically mingling with other races.  Half-Elves are common on Aklatoria and stand as a testament to this fact. Symbols of how differences between people can be conquered.

## Stronger Together
Half-Elven society stands along-side that of their parent races. In general, they are accepted as kin on both fronts, making them free to choose their own civil legacy. There are no Half-Elf civilization to be founded, and no city of state claiming to be purely for the benefit of the Half-Elf.  But their existence tells of union, where different peoples have come together and formed a new bod and a new, transformed way of thinking.

These societies tend to be respectable and well established, seeing as a union of species requires an enlightened way of life.

## Strange Dualisms
In [Kethraelm](../../geography/realms/kethraelm.md), Half-Elves are less common. It is a place where many things are uncertain, and as such Half-Elves are wary to proclaim themselves as in the other places. For in the Land of the Ice Queen resides many purists who still believe in the old ways of blood and the sword. And what is accepted in one house is often not the same in another.
