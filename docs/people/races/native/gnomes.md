# Gnomes

> The small framed cousins of the Elves, Gnomes are graceful and surefooted. They tend to be slender of build with round faces, their heads being larger by proportion than many other races.

> Their colours vary a great deal, but both skin and hair would naturally have a brighter hue than most, often forming purples, greens or yellows, bright and saturated. Males often flourish their bright features by growing elaborate moustaches while females keep their hair long and braided into spectacular shapes, the more outlandish the better. Eccentricity seems to be a natural inkling for them their clothing chosen to match.</br>

The Gnomes are born of the earth and part of its natural mysticism.  They are passionate by nature, about anything they pursue.  Though stereotypically mistaken as aloof and insignificant, little escape their keen senses and intelligence.

## Built for Industry
Where Gnomes band together expect anything and everything to happen in due time. No major Gnomish civilization exist on [Aklatoria](../../geography/aklatoria.md). They live together in large family groups, though often travel alone, driven by curiosity and adventure.

## Curious and Sharp
Easily intrigued, Gnomes excel at anything. Their minds are naturally sharp and they have an excellent sense of the people around them. Even though they are quick to read an analyse the behaviors of others, they often seem aloof and estranged at social queues. Their humour is often dry and a bit eccentric, with them not noticeably picking up on the awkwardness their own behavior may cause.

## Touched by the Aether
Mythically Gnomes are from the [Seed of the Moons](../../history/myths/seeds_of_life.md#the-seed-of-the-moons), being of the same ilk as Elves. Where they have been shaped by its application and understanding, the mind of the Gnome has always been more of a manifestation of its mystery. Gnomes are naturally attuned to magic, and many of them learn to cast spells at an early age. More than mere ability and talent, the [Myst](../../cosmology/planes/myst.md) forms part of Gnomish culture and it serves to fuel their desires and ambitions more so than with Elves.
