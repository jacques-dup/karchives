# Half-Orcs

> That-which-is-of-the-Taint manifests in many ways, and where the blood of the Orc-kin and that of the untainted races merge, a most interesting field of study did arise.

> Half-breeds are outcasts of their respective societies in most cases. The Taint as it is known makes for a noteworthy physical manifestation. Half-Orcs retain features of both their parent races. Some show less signs of the Taint than others. In various cases one would find it difficult to determine the half breed status without careful observation - going both ways. But for the most part a Half-orc would be a relative mix between that of the ork and that of the Other.</br>

*The Dark Taint* left the Orcs a savage and war loving race, infusing their half-breed kin with the same fire and physical strength.  But Half-Orcs are as varied as any of the other half-breed races.  Because of the physical manifestation of the *Taint* they are often faced with bigotry and ignorance, but are generally regarded as noble and respected by those of an open mind.

## Marked by Chaos
_The Taint_. Named as such by those not of it. An Instinct, a power of mind and body. A drive to greatness. A gift but also a curse. During the ages of Myth, the dark god [Garkash](../../religion/deities/garkash.md) cast across the world the essence of the [Seed of the Deep](../../history/myths/seeds_of_life.md#the-seed-of-the-deep)[^1].

Half-Orcs therefore experience the same _Calling of the Black Blood_, tied to the cycles of the Chaos-moon [Nox](../../cosmology/planes/nox.md) as the other races made from the _Lost Seed_. Though some embrace and actively seek out _The Calling_, others have learned to suppress it. In many cases the rage within them has lessened so much through the thinning of the bloodline, that they don't even feel a tingle down the spine come the Blood Moon Eclipse of Nox.

## Of two worlds
Being of two worlds, Half-Orcs are spread across cultures in many different ways. Either they are rejected and seen as lesser or impure by their progenitors, or they are held up as a paragon of further evolution of either species. Historically, they are creatures born into extremes. Either way they stand out within their mixed societies, watched and discussed, even studied.  They therefore tend to be loners for the most part, even among friendly faces.
