*The Dark Taint* left the Orcs a savage and war loving race, infusing their half-breed kin with the same fire and physical strength.  But Half-Orcs are as varied as any of the other half-breed races.  Because of the physical manifestation of the *Taint* they are often faced with bigotry and ignorance, but are generally regarded as noble and respected by those of an open mind.
