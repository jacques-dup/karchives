# Aarakocra

> The Bird-folk seem very much like giant birds when seen from afar. Only when they descend to roost or address does one see its slender, humanoid form. Standing upright on their hind legs, they might reach four to five feet in length, somewhat smaller when squatting in their perched positions.

> All Aarakocra have powerful wings and a bird-like face and beak, and tend to have a wide chest due to their large rib cages. Their "feet" are shaped as talons, like any lesser bird of prey, and feathers cover their bodies in a multitude of plumages. Fine, three fingered "hands", as deft and agile as any, often wield arms. </br>

The Bird-folk of [Aklatoria](../../geography/aklatoria.md) typically live a life of seclusion. Their settlements are small and far removed from the rest of the humanoid societies.  Their resemblance to birds are not limited to their physical appearance and as such their society is that of the flock, and their mannerisms are becoming of their form.

## The Awakened
Knowledge of their existence isn't wide spread, though they are commonly known in [Ilior](../../geography/realms/ilior.md) (where they are most prominent) the [Ni'arnfell](../../geography/realms/niarnfell.md) and [Iantear](../../geography/realms/iantear.md), though Druids of any land my know of them by reference.

Their Druid-given name is _Ivaetra_, which has a root in Elvish and would translate to "Awakened". They are often referred to by this name by Elves (even translated into more common variants meaning the same), though noe outside the druidic orders knows why the name was given. The address is seen as a form of respect, almost akin to an honourary title of sorts, though there are many Aarakocra who have never heard the name being used. This is mostly due to the fact that their societies rarely venture far away from their mountain sanctuaries.

??? warning "Secrets for Game Masters"
    The Aarakocra are referred to as "Awakened" as they are the product of Druidic Awakening. Though no one knows how long it has been since the first birds were anthropomorphized by magic, most such actions were taken with a great purpose in mind. Aarakocra stand out as they are the only of the "Beast-kin" that are referred to by this name, which might have to do with the fact that they chose to take up the role of _Cloud Wardens_ (whether that was their original purpose or not).

## Birds-of-a-feather
Aarakocra are birds of prey and creatures of solitude. Small family groups roost in the highest peaks of the tallest mountains and hunt the valleys below. Males tend to lead the flock, with the most colorful plumage indicating the most prestigious and worthy to follow. Grooming is an important part of their daily routine, cleaning their feathers and scratching away any pests they might pick up in the wilderness.

Tending to one's plumage is an important part of courtship, as different tribes get together to meet and breed every few months. Males impress the females with their colors and songs, and when chosen they are expected to move to the roost of their partner until their eggs are hatched. It is important for the females to choose strong males as partners as their prowess in combat would guard their roost for the coming months.

## Leaving the nest
Younglings, both male and female, are trained in the use of weapons from an early age, before they can even fly. Once they are old enough they undertake a trial, whereby they leave the Roost and venture into the valleys alone. They are expected to stay away until they bring back a single piece of wisdom, to be judged by the elders of the tribe.

This "wisdom" is subjective and ceremonial for the most part. The trial is to have the young live on their own, learn to survive without the flock, and to spread their wings as far as they can, for as long as they need, after which they can return to the Roost, satisfied that their place is with their family, and with their duty as the _Cloud Wardens_.

## Wardens of Purpose
The Aarakocra are known as friends and wardens by most who have had the privilege to encounter them. The locations of their villages tend to be chosen very strategically, often close to a temple of their common patron deity, [Armara](../../religion/deities/armara.md). Though not necessarily part of the clergy, it is often expected of young Aarakocra warriors to protect the artifacts these temples hold and has such earned the name of the _Cloud Wardens_. The clerics are also typically the only link with civilization they have, bringing trade and weapons to the Roost.

## Notes & Customs
- Nuts and berries form part diet of Aarakocra as they are omnivores. They trade these eagerly.
- They cultivate trees in most villages, but generally forage and hunt for food.
- A rare berry called "Summerblooms" grow on the peaks of Ilior's mountains. The are known for their bright, lily-like flowers and clustered, hard-shelled berries. Tasting between a walnut and a gooseberry, they are consumed in various dishes and drinks as an Aarakocra delicacy.
