# Chentoo

> To the untrained eye, these magnificent creatures will be easily confused with the tribal humans who dwell in the Ni'arnfell. They are as diverse as any or the other humanoids who walk the planes, yet distinct in biology from Humans as they are from Elves or Orcs.
> 
> What at first seems like some sort of tribal tattoo, is reveled to be natural stokes, like tiger stripes, across the face and body of the Chentoo. Their skin tends to be of darker shade, with thick manes of hair sprouting from their heads in dark colors. Their legs are shorter than Humans, stockier yet more streamlined for running, and all Chentoo have a long, bushy tail - like that of a feline predator. 
> 
> Another striking feature would be their eyes. Narrow slits with a silvery iris is their common look, though a few color variants exist. They are adapted to hunting at night alongside the tigers of the steppe.</br>

The Tiger tribes live secluded, nomadic lives in the wilderness of the [Ni'arnfell](../../geography/realms/niarnfell.md). They fend for themselves and rarely make themselves known to the outside world, but when they do they are amicable and interested, though never enough that they leave the fields they call home.

## Wild at heart
As one of the races born from the [Seed of the Sky](../../history/myths/seeds_of_life.md#the-seed-of-the-sky), Chentoo live in tribes and are native to the vast grasslands of the [Ni'arnfell](../../geography/realms/niarnfell.md). They are nomadic by nature and rarely deal with outsiders, often taking great steps to keeping intruders away from their camps.

They are known by the local civilized folk as kin to the steppe tigers that hunt side-by-side with these humanoids and are often referred to as "Tiger-folk".

## Like the River chooses its path
The Chentoo people are in tune with nature and the natural order more than any other intelligent race.  They are one with the land in body and spirit and tend to be neutral in most encounters.  They would describe their way as like that of the river, where the streams will flow where the path is best suited. But where a current can pull the tribe to a new path as well, if the rains are strong enough.

## Stalking eyes
Chentoo are solitary, and will never boast their full strength. When dealing with outsiders they are stoic and to the point. If threatened they never show their teeth before the moment they strike but do so ruthlessly and efficiently. Where possible they use pack tactics, where only one of their kin engage with the outsiders until the signal is given to attack.
