# Elves

> Typically tall and slender of build, the Elf-folk carry themselves with a deadly grace, unlike any other. Smooth skins of many variations and hair as varied as humans, with sharp features and characteristically pointed ears.

> Elves are born with a sword in one hand and a history book in the other. Their garb is almost always functional before ornamental and more often than not their body is decorated with the marks of their bloodline - elegant tattoos recognizable only to those who are learned in the histories of the people, or the families themselves.</br>

Mysterious, cunning and swift, the Elves stand out in the world as efficient in all they attempt and ruthless in its execution.  Never to be mistaken for timid or dispassionate, and secrecy comes as naturally to them as breathing.

## Blood and Glory
Since the ancient times, the Elven people have been at war. First with each other, and later unified against the Dwarven Imperium during the [Age of Stone](../../history/ages/age_of_stone.md). The long-living Elves were born as a culture of warriors and still to this day find honour in the mastery of the sword and battle magic. But in this modern age there are less wars to fight than in ages before.

Elves are predators in tune with nature, like a wild animal learned to play timid amongst the peaceful folk. At least that is what the stereotypes about them say. Also that they are cannibals and blood drinkers, which is only half true historically.

Being a culture driven by base desires, Elves also often procreate with other races they encounter. [Half-Elves](./half_elves.md) born from these unions often retain many of the characteristics of the Elf parent, and are generally accepted as kin in most parts of the world other than [Kethraelm](../../geography/realms/kethraelm.md).

With a history of blood and a culture of war, Elves are known as the best battle-masters in [Aklatoria](../../geography/aklatoria.md), serving under kings of any race as counsellors and generals. Tactics comes naturally to their keen minds and it serves them well still as it has done through the centuries.

## Shaped in Myst
Mythically, Elves are believed to be created from the [Seed of the Moons](../../history/myths/seeds_of_life.md#the-seed-of-the-moons). It fuels their fascination with the cosmic ebb-and-flow and the mysteries of the transcendental realms. Though it grants them an aptitude for wielding magic, culturally not many Elves pursue wizardry as an art form (though many learn to cast spells).

What it does mean is that all Elves have and affinity or resonance with the magical plane of [Myst](../../cosmology/planes/myst.md) in some way, at least historically. Paired with their natural keenness of mind makes the Elven people sensitive to the subtle shifts in cosmic essences, which enabled the ancient forbearers to develop a ritualistic type of naturalistic spellcasting, referred to as _Low Magic_, a knowledge now lost to the ages.

## Unified Responsibility
Of all the races, possibly being the most long lived of all, Elves share a unified sense of responsibility. The aggressive Dwarven settlement of the main continent of Aklatoria united the scattered Elven societies of the North into a unified army at the end of the [Age of Stone](../../history/ages/age_of_stone.md), and brought forth a new age of Elven dominion and the dawn of the [Age of the Stars](../../history/ages/age_of_the_stars), the Elven Golden Age.

The atrocities done during the great wars shocked the long-lived Elven folk, and the scar they caused on the land and within the cosmic resonance was felt by the whole of the people. Their age was therefore one of becoming. Great wars like the one they fought with the Dwarves should not be a mark of an age, nor a means to progress. They built their society as one searching for healing and common good.

## Above the rest
Elves are intelligent at their least, and brilliant, gracious and wise at their best. It makes them stand above many and in some cases makes them come over as condescending, most being oblivious to the fact. Their long lives and sense of purpose through historic account has them often trust important tasks only to themselves, without consulting others. They do not see the world as a fair place, where they stand at the top of the hierarchy in most things.

They respect others for their proven skills and abilities and value martial prowess or battle magic as the highest of virtues.
