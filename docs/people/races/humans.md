# Humans

> In the study of the species of Aklatoria none are so diverse, yet so similar to one another than the Humans. They tend to be influenced more by their environments than any of the other races and are therefore becoming to any culture or creed. At best they tend to follow in their own footsteps, and that of others, adapting to any and every setting they are exposed to.

A race born of the open fields and spread far, Humans were able to adapt in all regions of Aklatoria.  They are vast in differences and share only a sense of determination and an aptitude for diversity.  No one Human is as the next, and they tend to attune themselves culturally to anyone they come into contact with.

## Like the River Flows
Mythically from the [Seed of the River](../../history/myths/seeds_of_life.md#the-seed-of-the-river), Humans are strong of will, having a determination to survive unlike most. Their minds are ever changing, bringing out the best and worst adaptions across a broad spectrum. Their primary characteristic is that nothing is certain and that anything can be. being relatively short lived, their efforts at legacy take on strange, dualistic forms, and they are often content to just live out their days within the stability of their chosen profession and settlement.

## Jacks of all Trade
Humans are good at anything they put their mind to. They are known to devote their lives to one particular skill, philosophy or craft. Adding to the duality of their adaptability they can become very set in their ways, but from one human to the next, opinions, cultures, beliefs and more can be like night and day.

## Safety in Numbers
Humans flock together, and whereas a Dwarf or an Elf might be devoted to a single purpose, the Humans devote societies to their legacy. Their offspring carry forward their progress and inherit the responsibilities of the world. As such their pursuits at immortalizing their ideals has them founding orders and guilds of any kind. En-mass they become a force and a society to be reckoned with.
