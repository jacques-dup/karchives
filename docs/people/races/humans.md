# Humans

> Physical Description

A race born of the open fields and spread far, Humans were able to adapt in all regions of Aklatoria.  They are vast in differences and share only a sense of determination and an aptitude for diversity.  No one Human is as the next, and they tend to attune themselves culturally to anyone they come into contact with.
