# Dwarves

> Strong and hardy is the appearance of a Dwarf. They possess a natural endurance unlike any other race. They are often referred to as short, though they may grow as tall as humans in many cases, though tall Dwarves tend to have a hunched posture. With their broad chests and naturally bulbous posteriors, they may even stand out as giants.

> Dwarves take great pride in their appearance. Males tend to wear long, elaborate beards, whereas females tend to focus their attention of braiding their hair into countless styles. In all cases dying is common practice with jewels and baubles also making a frequent appearance. Their skin tends to be paler, after centuries of living underground, though it can range across any hue. Scars and tattoos are symbols of achievement, with the most experienced often being very intricately "decorated".</br>

Dwarves like to say that they were born from the Seed of the Mountain. They are naturally inclined toward the wonders of the natural world.  Born from the depths, shaped by war and tempered by ancient betrayal, the they are a race of warrior philosophers.  Strong of will and body, defiant in defeat, but easily pleased and honest to a fault.

## For King and Fatherland
The long-lived Dwarves have a society built on the stories and the deeds of the past. History and legacy play an important part in their civilization.  As such, all Dwarves of kin of [The Homeland](../../geography/realms/kalibora.md), where their High King resides in _Agamoria_. No matter where they reside, all are taught that their origin lies there, under the mighty _Üepithfjel Mountains_.

## Children of Adversity
Myth and the telling of the stories of the ancients play a very important role to the Dwarven society. They see themselves as the Children of [Ärun](../../history/myths/creation_dwarves.md), a race cursed by the ancients, yet able to not only survive, but overthrow all adversity. Determination brings honor and one is measured by the greatness of the legacy he can leave behind, no matter the odds that are stacked against him.

They teach their young of the ways they ancestors cast off the shackles of oppression by defeating the [Old Gods](../../religion/deities/dwarf_old_ones.md). A victory so great they were ascend to divinity as the [Erigrim](../../religion/deities/erigrim.md).

## The First Settlers
The first of the "modern" empires were that of the Dwarves. During the [Age of Stone](../../history/ages/age_of_stone.md) they expanded across the seas, to all the corners of [Aklatoria](../../geography/aklatoria.md). They are therefore prominent across all realms, and integrated into most societies.

Some settlements are completely diverse, yet the Dwarven way of life and their preference for living underground has many Dwarven Holds have a strictly Dwarven population. They are generally open to trade with any and all outsiders, however, and tend to be fair and honorable in their dealings.
