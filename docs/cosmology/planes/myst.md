> The _Myst-vision_ filled her eyes, making them marble-white. The room looked as it did before, for the most part, but now Ania could see the prismatic ribbons wave and curl around the mirror, reaching out to her outstretched hand as if sentient. The glass reflected a realm beyond. But as she was about to step through she felt that familiar tingle down her spine as if she was being watched.

> Turning, her face went pale as the Myst Aberration caught her eyes. If it could grin it would have, its maw of a thousand teeth opening slightly, nine tongues of acid licking at her face.

The _Myst Aether_ is a realm of ethereal wisps and magic. It transcends all physical planes, overlapping into the material realm through its _Roots_ and _Branches_. The visage of the _Myst Aether_ mimics the realms it touches, but weird and foreign phenomenon manifests itself through the misty skies of the transient plane. Prismatic ribbons shift and dance around objects of magic, and through it reveals a glimpse of what the true nature of things are.

Being exposed to the _Myst Aether_ is both mentally and physically draining, and touching it has strange effects on an object or an individual. The effects are as many as the number of accounts, but this draining effect is the reasons why practitioners of magic can only channel their powers for a limited amount before they need physical sleep.

## The Ripple
Close to the material realm are places where the _Myst Aether_ can overlap with reality. These _Ripples_ are attuned to magic and often become a [Source of Power](../magic.md#the-sources-of-power). They serve as the best gateways into the deeper parts of the _Myst Aether_ or when looking for _Ethereal Roots_ to follow.

The _Ripple_ can be seen manifest whenever a spell caster channels the _Myst Vision_ (Detect Magic). Given enough magical power, it can sometimes even be observed without the aid of a spell.

Especially in places attuned to magic or with natural gateways to other planes of existence, the _Ripple_ can manifest as a strange, thick fog that clings to the land, or tendrils of shadow that seem to reach out to things in proximity.

## Ethereal Roots
The _Myst Aether_ is bound to the [World Trees](../magic/places_of_power/world_trees.md), where its roots and branches pierce through the veil of space and time, entering the transient plane of Myst. This enables those that are skilled in the way of magic, to channel into the bindings between dimensions and even enter the _Myst Aether_ as a foreign object. From it they can skim on the wakes of space and time, travelling to distant lands or even the [Outer Worlds](../planes.md) in a heartbeat. Though finding and following the correct path can be tricky at best.

Staying bound on the Ethereal Roots are dangerous and should only be done in short bursts, lest one attracts the interest of the _Myst Abominations_ that feast on the essences of the tangible. These strange and mysterious creatures are the only known entities that can survive the metal and physical onslaughts the _Myst Aether_ radiates.

## Radiant Pools
Deeper inside the flows of the _Myst Aether_ are manifest deep pools of light, which can be seen from the Roots, where the terrain allows. It attracts multiple and the most powerful of _Myst Abominations_.

These pools erupt with a million sparkling stars, called _Star Storms_ on occasion. Not much is known of its true nature, but what is known, is that an eruption can spell impending doom, but also might aid one who walks the Roots. For the _Star Storms_ can pick up the ill-gotten traveller and fling her across the boundaries of time and space, into forgotten and unknown realities.
