# Artificium Campestribus

The plane of Invention is a strange and alien place.  It is a place of experimentation and study for most of its denizens.

For the most part, the plane is guided by the same physical laws as the material plane, but in various places these laws bend to align chaotically with that of the orther extradimentional realms.  Most prominent of these is it's link to the Realm of Mysts, manifesting often as gysers of rising steam.

Most noteworthy is the fact that the Artificium is never shrouded in darkness.  High above it's heavens circle multiple orbs of light, some said to be artificial in the making.  The cosmological paths of this plane is so intricate, that it is said that mortals who attempt to study its workings are known to be driven mad by its complexity.
