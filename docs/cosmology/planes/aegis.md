# Aegis

!!! info "Details"
    - **Type:** Inner Circle Plane
    - **Composition:** Single body orbital
    - **Dominion:** _Dominus Stasis Angelicae_, The Silver Court of Aegis

> The Great Spires of clear crystal line the horizon, a deep blue sliver against the black void above. Far in the heavens above lies Aklatoria, a bright and vibrant contrast to the white sands at your feet.

The Silver Moon is a strange land bound by strange laws. The surface is dominated by great stretches of white sand. Windless skies keeps it constant and nearly perfectly flat. Every piece of natural growth seems calculated, and sculpted according to a predetermined pattern. Great crystals spire parallel into the sky, "growing" naturally to form perfect caverns where the native creatures live.

Everything has a purpose in Aegis, and nothing is left to chance.

## Aegis Prime

> Ania stood there before the Glass Gates of Aegis Prime. Stern eyes looked upon the Elf as she approached with a tentative stride. She had in her possession a Silver Seal, which meant she could pass freely. But a gallery of Angels and Devils flanking her path menacingly did little to ease her steps. Passing through the precipice she paused, awestruck by the sight of the Great City in the Clouds. Alien structures of glass and crystal, mixed with foreign stones and steel, weaved into flowing shapes. Tall growths that seemed like trees grew in circular helixes, with softly glowing canopies of seemingly sentient stalks and brushes.

At the core of the plane lies a great city of Angels and Devils. Towering over the vast fields of white, its central spire houses the Silver Court, parliament of the Dimensional Beings and central seat of all Cosmic Law. It serves as the homestead of [Martivir](../../religion/deities/martivir.md), the Dragon Lord of All Justice.

Mortals seldom are allowed to enter the Gates of Aegis Prime, and needs to seek passage from one of the Great Noble Houses of Aegis. These ancient noble houses are able to grant a bearer a Silver Seal, granting them passage into the city for a single purpose: an audience with the Dominus Stasis Angelicae.

### Laws
Aegis in built on the concept of Law, and the application of law forms part of the cosmic substance of the plane itself. It drives all action with a justifiable and appropriate reaction according to the cosmic laws written down in the Central, Spire Temple of Aegis prime. There are thousands of laws and bylaws written into the stone tablets that form its foundation. But most important are the laws concerning mortals of Aklatoria and beyond.

??? abstract "Laws of Transvergeance"
    Laws pertaining the the travel between realms for Outsiders are captures into a set of Laws known as the Laws of Transvereange. In summary it states that no outsider may travel to the material realm without a host or anchor in place, sourced by a native of the plane. It also states the rules for travel into the [Nether Realms](../planes/nether.md) and the rules of engagement should any Noxians or mortals be encountered there.

??? abstract "Laws of Arbitration"
    Mortals may only enter the realm of Aegis if they possess an invitation in the form of a Silver Seal. These can only be created by the Noble Houses of Aegis and its sole purpose is to bring a mortal to the Courts of Aegis Prime for a cosmic ruling of some kind. Mortals who are discovered are captured and will most likely spend the remainder of their life in and out of holdings where they are to pass through the convoluted legislative processes of the Aegissian courts. Executions are common, though there are cases where mortals were sent to different planes as convict labourers or forces conscription into the Aegissian army.
