# Tundrum Arctis

The plane of Ice and Cold is one of the one of the primary elemental planes of existence that runs parallel to ['ad Materia](/cosmology/planes/ad_materia), the _Material Plane_.

Its lands consist of unending tundras at its most shallow, there where the veils between realms are narrowest, and only the divine knows the harshness of its depths.

Gateways into the plane are said to be the warmest, which is a hundred times colder than the coldest places on earth. The further one ventures from the gateways, the colder and darker it gets.

The lands of ice frequently sees storms of sleet and hail that even the denizens native to the plane fear and avoid.  Nothing here exists that cannot withstand the harshest cold in the cosmic realms.
