> Searching for the souls of the recently deceased is said to be an impossible task. Surely Ania thought as much as she stepped across the Ripple and into the place known as the Soul Forge. "Fitting," she thought to herself as she looked upon the shifting, ethereal echo of the room she stood before. Translucent bodies shifted through the walls of unrecognizable race or form. A cracking made her look down as she stepped forward onto a floor of bones and eyeless skulls piercing her with their gaze.
> 
> Shivering she forced her stride as the room around her shifted in a heartbeat. It felt "slow", like swimming in molasses, but also "fast" as the echo of what was the material plane streaked by.
> 
> ...There, beyond the veils of shadows and mounds of flesh she saw what she was looking for: A Stygian Pool filled with the writhing, moaning souls of thousands of recently dead. There stood at the bank an Angel of Death, stirring the pool with its tall ladle. And only a stroke of luck has left her yet unseen. A frown appeared on Ania's forehead. This is going to be harder than she thought.

There is no physical place in the cosmos that can describe the passage of time as well as the _Soul Forge_. A vision of ultimate destruction in death, but also in ultimate creation though resurrection. It reflects the [Material Realm](../planes/materia.md) to some extent, being an [Echo Plane](../planes.md#echo-realms) of it, but objects have little substance or reality here. The only truth about _Elysium_ is Shadow-manifest.

## Angels of Death
The divines tied to the cycles of life have an intimate connection with _Elysium_, like [Ornim](../../religion/deities/ornim.md) or [Zarach](../../religion/deities/zarach.md). Their agents roam the _Soul Forge_, tending to the millions of ethereal wisps that once were sentient.

These agents are collectively known as _"Angels of Death"_, though not much is know of their true nature or origins. They do not speak and their action are guided by the cosmic balance of the universe, sometimes even contradicting the will of the gods that claim dominion of the dead.

These entities are known to be able to traverse the boundaries between realms without effort, harvesting souls that are said to be at odds with the the balance of the cosmic reality.

## Stygian Pools
Some locations in _Elysium_ manifest, where masses of ethereal wisps will conjugate in massive pools of ectoplasmic substance. It is a haunting visage and _Angels of Death_ frequently tend to these pools, stirring them with long ladle-like spears of black obsidian.

It is believed that these pools are the entry points into _Elysium_ for the recently deceased. The ethereal wisps moan and scream in haunting tones as their life essence fade into the fabric of the plane itself, being consumed by it and fueling its existence.

## Cosmic Chains
There are places in the _Soul Forge_ that are closely aligned with the _Ripples_ from the [Myst Aether](../planes/myst.md). These manifest as massive, radiant chains, stretching into the dark skies of the plane. They are said to be the anchors that bind the roots and branches of the [World Trees](../magic/places_of_power/world_trees.md) into Aklatoria and its cosmic neighbors.
