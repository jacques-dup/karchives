# Heldar

> Literal Translation: The Godsâ€™ Hearthplace

Heldar is the celestial plane of the Dwarves.  All virtuous Dwarves wish to one day be granted passage into this heaven of eternal sport, revelry, battle and friendship.  Here the souls of Dwarven warriors are in an eternal struggle against the devils of [Reilagg](/cosmology/planes/reilagg) and their patron [Durathor](/religion/deities/erigrim#durathor).  Heldar is described as a deep city beneath the biggest mountain in creation.  It runs so deep that its caverns reach the eternal darkness of Reilagg and it is here where the battles are fought.
