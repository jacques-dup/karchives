> Magma bubbles up through the crimson rocks, the smell of brimstone expunging all other senses. Great bulges of aberrant fauna crack open the jagged soil. The sky bleeds a marble glint onto the horizon, almost a a beacon of hope in the dark chaotic world, but alas. There are no constants in this ever shifting plane, no certainty and no points of reference. It is a place of lost souls, and dangerous, epically dangerous creatures, unbound by that alien concept of justice.

The Red Moon of Aklatoria, Nox the eternal. A land bound only by the cosmic truth of chaos has no shape or constant form. Its features shift constantly, the only common aspect being the crimson colored terrain. Storms are a constant threat, bringing acid rains and fiery skies. But even more obtrusively, the plane affects one's mind and moods in a psychic onslaught. As if not enough, great areas of Wild Magic exist as the lines between the [Myst](../planes/myst.md) become blurred.

Cities exist on the rugged land, mostly carved out from deep caves and fortified by divine magic. Many dot the land, but they are as dangerous as the wilderness around it, for the denizens consist of all manner of chaotic outsiders.

## Hierarchies of Chaos
Nox is not ruled. It is not owned or even wants to be owned. What exists instead of governance are factions of opinion and enforcement. These factions are known as _Circles_ and the most powerful of them determine the progress and ambitions of the plane's denizens.

**Most Influential Circles**

??? abstract "Arx Convex"
    The first natives of Nox were the Eladrin, a intra-dimensional race who settled on Nox as it was birthed from the Transient [Myst](../planes/myst.md). The hold no moral affiliation, but worship the Chaos Dragon _Okantunth, The Mammoth Dread_, whom they bound to the plane of Nox. They hold the most sway over Nox and have formed many great cities.

    Leadership comes from their clerical sect, named _Arx Convex_, the followers of the Chaos Dragon. Their soul purpose is to serve the will of the Chaos Dragon, and wage the eternal war to eradicate the influences of [Aegis](../planes/aegis.md) on the cosmos.

??? abstract "Proteans"
    Considered the stongest creatures in all of Nox, the Proteans is a collection of powerful Empyrean Titans who revels in the ideals of chaos. They follow no rules and consider no guidance, but through the promise of glorious battle they can be persuaded to any cause.

??? abstract "Circle of the Chaos Queen"
    At the forefront of the destructive natures of the Red Moon stands the divine sect of the goddess of chaos itself, [Seth](../../religion/deities/seth.md). Outsiders who serve her on Nox join up with the divine temple of the [Chantry](../../religion/organizations/chantry_of_the_sisters.md). It is said that the goddess herself has a sanctuary at the heart of the temple and through the nature of the land her influence is especially strong.

## Gateways
Being part ot the [Inner Circle Planes](../planes.md#inner-circle), Nox is cosmically tied to Aklatoria, and many gateways exist between dimensions through the [Nether Realm](../planes/nether.md). There are no known gateways directly between the two, and it is written in the [Laws of Transvergeance](../planes/aegis.md#laws), that no direct gateway between the _Inner Circle_ planes can exist and can only be bound through the Nether.

The [Transient Myst](../planes/myst.md) is also very present on Nox and as such _Ripples_ are bountiful, uncontrolled and coincidental for the most part.
