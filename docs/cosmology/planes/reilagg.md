# Reilagg

> Literal Translation: the Lair of Vermin

This is the domain of the god [Durathor](../../../religion/deities/erigrim#durathor), antithesis of the [Erigrim](../../../religion/deities/erigrim).  It is a place to be feared and fought against.  It is not seen as a place of punishment (such as many humans believe) where un-virtuous Dwarves are sent after death.  It is the core that drives the war on [Heldar](../heldar), the corruption of the deep caverns.  The Reilagg is said to be existing both in the realm of the gods and on the [Azthin](../materia).  When You dig deep enough you might open a cavern into this forsaken realm.
