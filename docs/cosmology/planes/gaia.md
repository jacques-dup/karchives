> The tops of the colossal trees, blooming with millions of soft toned bulbs, towered up into the aurora winds. True monoliths of the Fey, a tribute to the primal essences of nature. The contraption fitted to the massive trunk seemed almost alien, like a giant mechanical lizard snaking its way down in a smooth motion. Aria had to go deep into the core of Gaia to find what she sought. Deeper than the elaborate caves dug by the _Kazugrö_.
> 
> The mechanical lizard stuck its tendrils into the earth as the descended into the deep. Lights danced as critters and fungi fled from its path. It slithered through the majestic Undermountain, pillars of crystal intertwined with roots and gigantic mushroom trees lighting the way down. The sight was beautiful yet primal and instinctual. Aria shuddered at the thought of her losing her mind to this place, as so many have done before her.

Gaia, or _The Fearie_ as some call it is a wonderful and majestic place that mimics the natural flows of the [Material Realm](../planes/materia.md). It stands as the primal source of what the world is intended to be in ots most primordial form, and its energies feed the power of the [World Trees](../magic/places_of_power/world_trees.md) across the cosmos.

## Time and Timelessness
The concepts of time, cause and effect, and the nature of the passing moments are obscured, skewed and ambivalent In some instances it seems to be a realm untouched by change, and in contrast it can be more chaotic than [Nox](../planes/nox.md) itself. It is common to see cities appear overnight as if a hundred years have passed, only to disappear like mist before the sun, as if its rise was a mere dream.

Its nature has Gaia locked in a state of perpetual motion in a motionless bubble. Seconds can translate to hours in the [material world](../planes/materia.md), and equally an adventure of a decade may be a few weeks. As such the denizens of Gaia are foreign to the concepts of time and industrial progress.

## The Roots of the Worlds
Within Gaia is the strongest seeping of the [Myst Aether](../planes/myst.md) of any of the cosmic dimensions. The whole plane is in effect a colossal [Myst Ripple](../planes/myst.md#the-ripple). As such it is a greatly magical place, attuned to the ebbs and flows of the Myst.

At the heart of Gaia is the primordial manifestations of the [World Trees](../magic/places_of_power/world_trees.md). They tower into the heavens of Gaia, their canopies the platforms for the greatest cities of the Fey, and their roots sinking into the furthest reached of the _Undermountain_

## Undermountain
Deep below the soil, where the sun of Gaia never touches, is a place of lights and shadows known as the _Undermountain_. Massive caverns open up to foreign, magical places. Untouched by even the concepts of time and space, they are bubbles of history, capturing the essences of every primal and modern age of Aklatoria.

Within it lives everything that ever was, and everything that will ever be, as if a picture painted to encapsulate the primal form of what it is to represent. It is impossible in practice, to navigate the tunnels of the _Undermountain_ and only a handful of its _Visions_, as the denizens call them are frequented. The largest of the _Visions_ are inhabited by a strange, Dwarf-like folk, called the _Kazugrö_. These resourceful, yet simple creatures spend their time endlessly digging and excavating the mines of _Undermountain_ and is rumoured to have ways of moving beyond the limits of the realm.

## Cities in the Sky
High above the treetops, the resourceful Fey of Gaia have built their cities. Mountains floating on the wind dance across the skies. Some are trussed to the branches of the [Manifested World Trees](#the-roots-of-the-worlds), others have bridges spanning miles to one another and the mountains below. Others still have massive sails of Myst engines to steer them across the heavens.

Each of the cities is home to one of the Arch-Fey, where they court and play the game of politics. They reflect the whims and characteristics of their progenitors in a physical way. Some are eternally basked in sunlight while others are overgrown and wild. Some have majestic spires where their citizens live, while others are filled with caves and tunnels. The possibilities of each are endless and due to the nature of the realm (and its progenitor), this can even change, sometimes violently.

## The Primordial and the Arch-Fey
Mimicking the primal natures of the dimension, Gaia is under the rule and/or guidances of several ancient, Arch-Fey. Though their power may rival that of the [gods of Aklatoria](../../religion/deities/../index.md) in some instances, it is bound to the physical realm of Gaia itself due to the intangible nature if the dimension, though it is possible to make pacts with them as a Warlock.

Each of the Arch-Fey have their own ambitions, but they are all primal in nature. Their emotions are always an extreme, almost overly exaggerated version of itself, which can be a very dangerous experience.

But the source of all the Arch-Fey's power is what is known as _The Primordial_. It is what drives the tangible magic and keeps the realm of Gaia manifest within Aklatoria.  No one knows what _The Primordial_ truly is, but it is known to be sentient to some extent at least, and that it grants powers based on merit. The most common belief for the denizens of Gaia is that _The Primordial_ is one of the ancient creator gods, resting at the core of the cosmos and that Gaia is the manifestation of its dreams.
