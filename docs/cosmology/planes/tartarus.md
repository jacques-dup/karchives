> The Dwarf guide said it had been a few weeks since they left the surface, but it was too deep for him to be too certain. No one ventures this deep into the core of the world. Ania had tried to keep her _Myst-vision_ active as much as she could, and she could see the _Ripples_ in reality grow stronger the deeper they went.

> It might be some time before they find a precipice to step forth into _Tartarus_. She wasn't sure how she would read the signs. But to get to her destination beyond the veils of the material realm, she had to pass into the planar echo first. Then she had to seek the battlements of the _Seven Suns_ beyond, to request passage through one of the planar gates.

_Tartarus_ lies parallel in reality to the material world. It echoes and spills into reality similar to the _Ripples_ of the [Myst Aether](../planes/myst.md), but deep underground where the earth is anchored to its axis. Its features mimic that tof the deep, cavernous underground, opening up into massive caves, lava pools and black stone.

Throughout _Tartarus_, gateways open to the [Inner Circle](../planes.md#inner-circle) planes, naturally forming and anchored in space. This enables denizens of both [Aegis](../planes/aegis.md) and [Nox](../planes/nox.md) to freely venture into _Tartarus_. It has caused the Nether to be a continuous battleground between the forces of cosmic _Law_ and _Chaos_. The land itself takes on some properties of the realms it connects to, the essences of all seeping into the fabric of _Tartarus_. And so the eternal clash of Order and Entropy is echoed onto the [Material Plane](../planes/materia.md) as well.

## The Shallows
The places that overlap into the deep underground of Aklatoria is known as the _Shallows_, or the _Shallow Nether Realm_. It mostly resembles the natural underground of the [Material Plane](../planes/materia.md), with only the occasional anomaly revealing the true nature of the area. Outsiders may roam these areas, though their numbers are little. Magic flourishes and [Ripples](../planes/myst.md#ripples) are plentiful, but especially where the presence of Chaos is strongest it becomes unpredictable and volatile.

## The Caverns
As one ventures deeper into _Tartarus_ there is no doubt as to the nature of the location. Myst seeps into the planar echo, and seems to glow visibly in some places, whipping tendrils of prismatic ribbons or black sludge around the rocks and other features. Massive caverns opens up to a starless ceiling, the walls seemingly carved smooth by an unknown sentience into unnatural patterns. Stones are scarred black from non-existent fires and strange, shadows seem to jump and shift, gurgling and bubbling as they pass through the solid stone.

## Citadels
Areas where the two opposing planes of [Aegis](../planes/aegis.md) or [Nox](../planes/nox.md) meld into _Tartarus_ take on some of the features of the interlinked dimension. The presence of the seeping realities become strongholds of the occupying force, commonly referred to as _Citadels_.

These _Citadels_ may become structures resembling the cities of their origin, and are named and mapped by the two warring factions. Between them lies destruction and carnage as the armies of cosmic _Law_ and _Chaos_ clash in everlasting battles.
