# Magic

> The roots of the World Trees grow deep into the corners of creation. Their power seeps into the soils of many worlds, emanating in clouds of raw power. Those who once knew it by nature named it _Myst_, the Ethereal force that binds us all to the will of the gods.

Magic in [Aklatoria](../../geography/aklatoria) is plentiful and seemingly endless in nature. It is found everywhere, and in some cases societies have thrived though its universal application.

But it is a resource bound by rules - the physics, if you will, of the cosmos. Drawing its power to shape the world has consequences, and it is not certain if even [Maia](../../religion/deities/maia), the goddess of the Arcane even knows or understands them all.

## The Myst
The substance of magic, if it can be called as such, is labelled as Myst. In part the same "thing" that makes up the transient plane of [Myst Aether](../planes/myst), but also a "substance" of sorts on its own. It can manifest as smokey tendrils the eye can see, invisible sparkling fixtures or even tangible crystals. The physical representation of the Myst is endless.

The Myst substance has locked inside of it the patterns of the cosmos, mirrored to some extent in physical form. These patterns can be unraveled by skilled Mages to produce magical effects, commonly known as spells.

The shapes and forms of The Myst are endless and ever changing. It flows and shifts, almost as if alive, or being driven by a collective consciousness. It is eternal and yet limited. It is a weave of potential surrounding all creation and the fuel for it, in itself.

What is known as fact though, is that the Myst manifests in physical objects, known as **Sources of Power**. These objects or places take on som of the physical properties of the Myst Substance and serve as a strong bond between the Material realm and the transient plane it originates from.

## The Sources of Power
The sources of power are physical objects or locations where the Myst is anchored to Aklatoria. Strange things can happen around these Sources, yet history shows that they bring balance to the natural world. The strongest of the Sources are the [Great World Trees](./places_of_power/world_trees).

    - Celestial Bodies (The Sun, [Aegis](../planes/aegis), [Nox](../planes/nox), etc.)

## Practitioners
The flow of the Myst can be harnessed by mortals by means of linking themselves to a _Source_ of power. Theoretically any being can be bound to such a source and become a wielder of magical power. But only some are able to attune themselves to a truly powerful source.

The road to becoming a practitioner begins with the binding. Different organizations have different ceremonies and steps required for this binding. It can be forced through a Magical Ritual, or spontaneously happen due to an unknown amount of factors, including pacts with gods or outsiders, consuming or absorbing the power of a magical object or activating a dormant bloodline link.

This bind manifests in various ways, but typically has some physical representation, know as the "Myst Soul". These can include familiars, bonded items, birthmarks, a Holy relic, or even physical traits like a halo or glowing eyes. But in truth this physical manifestation is merely a symbol of the binding and can even be changed.
