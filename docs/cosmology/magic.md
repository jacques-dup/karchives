# Magic

> The roots of the World Trees grow deep into the corners of creation. Their power seeps into the soils of many worlds, emanating in clouds of raw power. Those who once knew it by nature named it _Myst_, the Ethereal force that binds us all to the will of the gods.

Magic in [Aklatoria](../../geography/aklatoria) is plentiful and seemingly endless in nature. It is found everywhere, and in some cases societies have thrived though its universal application.

But it is a resource bound by rules - the physics, if you will, of the cosmos. Drawing its power to shape the world has consequences, and it is not certain if even [Maia](../../religion/deities/maia), the goddess of the Arcane even knows or understands them all.
