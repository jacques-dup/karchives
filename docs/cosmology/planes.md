# Planes

> The realms of Myst stretch far into the universe. At night, when the Sun's blinding light has faded, you can see the constellations of the outer worlds in the heavens. But Aklatoria is a place of flux, where the nature of the cosmos is most profound. It stands as the pinnacle, a anchor of sorts, at the centre. And its Great World Trees bind all of creation to it.

The nature of the universe, the _Myst_ and Magic is balance. Without the balance, there is no cosmos. And Aklatoria, the prime [Plane of Existence and Substance](./planes/materia) is the scales responsible for that balance.

Many cosmic planes exist beyond, and a number of them inside, or parallel to the Material realm. These are categorized into groups, depending on their nature.

## Transient Planes
Beneath, parallel, universal, encompassing. The link between the tangible realms require a _"vessel"_ or sorts, or rather, a _"glue"_ that binds these places together. As soap bubbles cling together on the surface, forming an absolute, yet fragile and shifting boundary.

??? abstract "Known Transient Planes:"
    - _**[Myst:](./planes/myst)**_ The Ethereal plane of Magic.

## Echo realms
These planes exist in parallel to the Material realm and to some extent form part of it. They connect through the roots of the World trees and as such, the borders between them are often blurred.

??? abstract "Known Echo Realms:"
    - _**[Nether:](./planes/nether)**_ The parallel battlegrounds of Law and Chaos. Also known as _Limbo_.
    - _**[Soul Forge:](./planes/soul_forge)**:_ The _core_ of the world, the primal source of its mystical powers. The place where the essences of life rests.
    - _**[Gaia:](./planes/gaia)**_ The _heart_ of the world, where the primordial essence of nature is bound.

## Inner Circle
The Inner Circle groups together the planes in close cosmic proximity to Aklatoria and the Material Realm. They tend to influence Aklatoria to some degree due to this proximity.

??? abstract "Known Inner Circle Planes:"
    - _**[Aegis:](./planes/aegis)**_ The Silver Moon. Pinnacle of Law and Order and the home of Lawful Outsiders.
    - _**[Nox:](./planes/nox)**_ The Crimson Moon. Pinnacle of Chaos and Destruction and the home of Chaotic Outsiders.
    - _**[Ordinia:](./planes/ordinia)**_ The Floating Castle of Selflessness and Justice, circling the Sun and home to the Divine Lawbringers.
    - _**[Crevatorus:](./planes/crevatorus)**_ The Scattered Debris of The Void Seed, filled with deep holes and gateways to the Abyss.

## Outer Circle:
The Outer Circle groups together the planes that are spread far from Aklatoria. They form the constellations of the night sky and serve as beacons to the single principles or portfolios held by the Divines.

??? abstract "Known Outer Circle Planes:"
    - _**[Ruune (The Crown):](./planes/ruune)**_ The vault of [Maia](../../religion/deities/maia), filled with starlight of gold.
    - _**[Shole (The Phoenix):](./planes/shole)**_ The fiery sky world of [Armara](../../religion/deities/armara).
    - _**[Eltis (The Hare):](./planes/eltis)**_ The paradise world of [Na√°sh Feramil](..ties/naash_feramil)
    - _**[Umber (The Emerald Lion):](./planes/umber)**_ The Three-sun vigil, claimed by [Lord Aster](../../religion/deities/../../docs/religion/deities/lord_aster.md)
    - _**[Onus (The Southern Chalice):](./planes/onus)**_ The barren land where the spirit of [Erthan](../../religion/deities/erthan) has its final rest after the apocalypse.
    - _**[Kesra (The Great Tree):](./planes/kesra)**_ The sprouting root world of the Great Trees amd gateway to the Far Realms, claimed by [Opus](../../religion/deities/opus).
    - _**[Kelon (The Fractured Wheel):](./planes/kelon)**_ The sanctuary where [Ornim](../../religion/deities/ornim) tends the graceless dead.
    - _**[Eskall (The Anvil):](./planes/eskall)**_ The plane of everlasting cosmic storms, guarded by [Tor](../../religion/deities/tor).

### Far Realms
Beyond the boundaries of space and time is a place that is not a place, called the Far Realms. Few divines have ventured close to its borders and even less have returned unscathed. It is a place of even greater secrecy than the knowledge of creation.

??? abstract "Known Far Realm Objects"
    - _**[Hole to the Void:](./planes/void_of_creation)**_ A deep, black hole at the edge of space and time. What lies on the other side is unknown.
    - _**[Artificium Campestribus:](./planes/artificium_campestribus)**_ A vessel of exploration, sent by [Irthor and Kidan](./deities/irthor_&_kidan) to study the Black Hole, now lost to time itself.
