# Cosmology

The cosmos is built on dualism. And endless shifting between Order and Chaos. Mysterious powers from beyond the veil of space and time influencing reality like a dark force creating rippling echoes throughout the universe.

Central to the dualism, is the ability to tap into these forces, and channel its power to endless possibilities. The nature of these powers are known, mapped in lore, but to say there is any being that truly knows its limits, or even its purpose, is to profess foolishness.
