# The Six Tablets of Verashuun
Found scattered around several of their ruins, each of the tablets are preceded by an introductory stanza, followed by the tablet writings associated with one of the primary virtues of their society.

i.
> So teaches Verashuun.  The _wisdom/thoughts/will/being_* of Aevum will be revealed to those who seek the council of his clerics.  In the darkest of night, the candle burns bright; so in the sun’s mighty glow, the shadows cut stone.

_* Actual translation unknown.  The word used, "elpovei'vüm" has no known meaning, but has roots in all listed concepts_

1.
> As the seasons come and go the ancient ones had always looked to the spirits.  They saw them in a Great Wheel which cycles through time.  As one era ends, another will follow.  And as nature is shown to repeat itself repeat upon itself, the ancients believed that the universe continues forever.  What once was will begin again and will be so until the end of all times. 

2.
> But for there to be an end, there has to be a beginning.  And like two pillars they have kept the course of all history standing.  Time flows from one pillar to the next in a continuous cycle of repetition.  It drives its denizens to progress.  It creates the waves of change.  But like the ocean time flows.  Like a thousand oceans it is vast.  And no wave can break the cycle of time.

3.
> The ancient ones thought themselves wise.  But a child is naïve to believe an ocean has no bounds.  For the cosmos is like the sky and it is like the mountains.  It is like the stars that are doors to uncountable and unknown elements.  The cosmos is like them all. 

4.
> But most of all the universe is made with balance.  Not one of light and darkness, but of stasis and entropy.  Of structure and the lack thereof.  From it is born everything of both good and evil and without it the cosmos has no beginning.  It has no end.  The ocean can have no waves without the law of the moons and the pillars of time can have no footing to stand upon.

5.
> The father of all order is stasis.  It creates the structure needed to maintain the universe.  And thus in the beginning there was only stasis.  But existence is true and stasis has no meaning without entropy.  Stasis is filled with unfathomable potential, the energy of the spirits.  This both order and chaos becomes the footing upon which the pillars of time can stand.

6.
>Nothing can exist without structure.  Nothing can continue without change and movement.  It was realized by the ancients that the source of this energy is the divine will to be.  They gave it a name.  They called it Aevum in their language.  The creator.  The truth.  The bringer of life. God.
