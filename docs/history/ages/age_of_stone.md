# The Age of Stone
##### The Rise of the Dwarves
Near the end of the _Time of Turmoil_, the Dwarven race discovered the Runestone Tablet.  They had rejected their old gods and were at the time in an all out war against them.  The Runestone enabled a group of them to ascend to divinity themselves.  They are known as the [Erigrim](/religion/deities/erigrim).

## The Discovery of the Runestone
The God Wars were different for the Dwarven people.  Not only did they fight a war on multiple fronts, they were fighting against what many believed at the time, to be divine beings - [_The "Bellan"_ (Old Ones)](/religion/deities/dwarf_old_ones).

During their first confrontation with their old gods, the Dwarves discovered an artifact called _"Thorgen"_, or sometimes _The "Yurrir"_ (The Runestone).  This artifact in time had a group of Dwarven leaders ascend to divinity, and enabled the Dwarves to unlock the secrets of Rune Magic, giving them an incredible edge in the battles of the God Wars.  Their triumphs uttered in a new age of Dwarven civilization.

The myth of how they discovered the Runestone are told as part of the [Genesis of the Erigrim](/religion/deities/erigrim#genesis)

## The Global Dwarven Empire
Their empire grew vast and they spread their fortresses across Aklatoria.

## Unbreakable Elves
As the Empire approached the unending forests of the North, they were met with the Elven barbarians, a foe who possessed a battle prowess they have never before seen, and powerful magic to rival their runes.

## The Fall of the Empire
