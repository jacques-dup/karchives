# The Age of Stone
## The Rise of the Dwarves {: .subtitle }
Near the end of the _Time of Turmoil_, the Dwarven race discovered the Runestone Tablet.  They had rejected their old gods and were at the time in an all out war against them.  The Runestone enabled a group of them to ascend to divinity themselves.  They are known as the [Erigrim](/religion/deities/erigrim).

## The Discovery of the Runestone
The God Wars were different for the Dwarven people.  Not only did they fight a war on multiple fronts, they were fighting against what many believed at the time, to be divine beings - [_The "Bellan"_ (Old Ones)](/religion/deities/dwarf_old_ones).

During their first confrontation with their old gods, the Dwarves discovered an artifact called _"Thorgen"_, or sometimes _The "Yurrir"_ (The Runestone).  This artifact in time had a group of Dwarven leaders ascend to divinity, and enabled the Dwarves to unlock the secrets of Rune Magic, giving them an incredible edge in the battles of the God Wars.  Their triumphs uttered in a new age of Dwarven civilization.

The myth of how they discovered the Runestone are told as part of the [Genesis of the Erigrim](/religion/deities/erigrim#genesis)

## The Global Dwarven Empire
With the newfound power of the Runestone, the Dwarves found their capital and called it Agamoria in reverence to their patron Saint Agamor.  Using Rune Magic to carve the walls of the city, they built a stronghold that could survive a direct onslaught from the [Reilagg](/cosmology/planes/reilagg) and house an army of 10 000 for months.

Their new found strength also had them expand.  They started winning battles against the [Old Gods](/religion/deities/dwarf_old_ones), as well as any new enemy they faced.  _The First Rune Army_ marched across _Kalibora_ until they reached the ocean - and they built ships to cross it reaching new lands.  Their empire grew vast and they spread their fortresses across Aklatoria.

With their conquest they brought commerce, culture and technology, uplifting primitives and crushing competition.

## Unbreakable Elves
As the Empire approached the unending forests of the North, they were met with the Elvin barbarians, a foe who possessed a battle prowess they have never before seen, and powerful magic to rival their runes.

The Elves were ruthless in battle and the Dwarven expansion halted.  Soon the Elves rallied in numbers and pushed back the Dwarven lines.  They formed an unbreakable barrier, no matter the flood of troops the Empire was sending to enforce the lines.  The battle became a war, and the war soon escalated into a power struggle between _Runes_ and _Elvin Blood Magic_.

## The Fall of the Empire
Records speak of the day when Nox eclipsed Aegis, and the realms were thrown into chaos.  The cosmological event was foreseen by the Elves, attuned to the Myst-realm.  They planned for the day to come, and when it was upon them they threw all their might at the center of the Dwarven power: the [Tree of Bonaduic](/cosmology/magic/places_of_power/world_trees#tree-of-bonaduic).  The ancient tree was said to be the primary root of the Runestone's power in Aklatoria.

The Elves destroyed the Tree, and what followed was utter destruction.  The cosmic balance had been upset and creation shook the earth and heavens.  Stars fell from the sky and the land where the Tree had stood turned barren and dry.

The war against the Elves proved too much for the Empire to sustain.  The earth was revolting against their conquest and they fled back to their homeland.  Most of the Dwarven armies returned to Kalibora, and the realms were ripe for the taking.
