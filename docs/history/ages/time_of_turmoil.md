# The Time of Turmoil
##### The Dark Ages
Some time after the [Seeding](/history/ages/age_of_seeding) the new races of Aklatoria spread to the corners of the known world.  Kin of the Seeds flocked together, wary of each other.  Differences divided the world.

In their infantile understanding of the universe, the races were easily influenced by the new gods.  Patrons were chosen, and the new gods, in their inexperience as deities, granted favour as power without thought.  It fueled the greed of the young races.  Soon all kinship was lost, as the power of the gods were tied to the worship given to them.

## The God Wars
The friction manifested though many proxy wars between the new peoples of Aklatoria.  New gods were born, others died out, but the world could not progress without a resolution.

This _Time of Turmoil_ lasted for a few thousand years. It kept the races of Aklatoria in a Dark age, unable to progress and grow.

## The Dwarven Salvation
Near the end of the _Time of Turmoil_, the Dwarven race discovered the Runestone Tablet.  They had rejected their old gods and were at the time in an all out war against them.  The Runestone enabled a group of them to ascend to divinity themselves.  They are known as the [Erigrim](/religion/deities/erigrim).

The Runestone gave the Dwarves unparalleled power as a nation, and soon they expanded their empire across all the realms of Aklatoria.  With an unyielding demeanor they grew, liberating those who accepted their dominion and crushing those who stood in their way.  It was the dawn of the [Age of Stone](/history/ages/age_of_stone).
