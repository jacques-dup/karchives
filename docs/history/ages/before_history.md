# The Ages before History

## Ancient beings
It is recorded that at the beginning of time only two truly intelligent races resided on Aklatoria.  These were the _Neliavth_ and the _Dragons_. Both possessed inherent magic and were naturally bound to the Myst, wielding power unlike anything in the modern world.

### Dragons
The Dragons at that time had no desire to rule over Aklatoria and only longed to be reunited to their mother, _Mekla_ the Sea Serpent.  They hoarded knowledge and roamed the lands, solitary or in small groups.

It is unknown if any of the ancient knowledge survives to this day.  The dragons have changed much since this time and none of the truly ancient Wyrms still live.  What they know they keep to themselves.

### Neliavth
Very little is known of the ancient civilization, the _Neliavth_, and what is recorded in the Kobold Archives is mostly incomplete.  The name _Neliavth_ is what is believed these beings called themselves, but societies existed within this collective, each with their own legacy.

The Neliavth vanished from Aklatoria, long before the oldest of the current races were born, but their ruins can still be found in many remote places of the world.  Over the years, historians have gathered some knowledge about them, albeit obscure an prone to conjecture.

Their cities were built on industry in the pursuit of knowledge, as explained by the [Six Tablets of Verashuun](/history/artifacts/six_tablets_of_verashuun).

One division of this ancient race, called the _Vestath_, built immense monuments and cities - now ruins in the modern world.  They acknowledged a few other societies within their kinship:  The _Lauranith_, a nomadic, but wise people, who traded throughout the empire.  The _Neshaan_, who secluded themselves in the forests of old and rarely mingled with the other societies.  And also the _Shar_, who apparently befriended the Dragons in order to betray them.

## Ancient Conflicts
Resources indicate that at one point, the Dragons looked to their neighbors and saw the amazing feats they achieved using their innate magic.  They started to believe that the only way to their mother was to utilize this magic.  Resources are conflicting when referencing how their relationship deteriorated, but it is commonly believed that generations of robbery and disregard for each other, two races found themselves on opposite ends of a full scale war.

The different tribes of the Neliavth united in this time, calling themselves the _Ameth_ - roughly translated to “warriors”, or even “blood-kindred”.  The war lasted for eons, fought on an epic scale and fuelled by the ancient, powerful magic of these two races.

## The Vanishing
Never is it recorded that any side had won.  Writings speak of defeat and victories on both sides.  The last Vestathi works speak of a search for the Ethdarin – possibly an ancient artefact to unlock the meaning of life - before their civilization vanished completely and unexpectedly.
