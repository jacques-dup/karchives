# The Age of the Stars
## Elvin Dominion {: .subtitle }
The Elves of old were as fierce as they were intelligent and the marching tide of Dwarves from the south united them in battle.  Since the [Age of Seeding](../age_of_seeding) they were blessed with a natural link to the Myst, and the god wars had trained them in its use for destruction.  Their sorcerers faced off against the Dwarven Rune Lords and the world shook in its wake.

## The Destruction of the Tree
The Elves pushed back the Dwarven advance using their superior knowledge of magic, taking up key locations around the [World Trees](../../../cosmology/magic/places_of_power/world_trees) in order to strengthen their power.  But the Dwarves knew the secrets of the mountains below, and the two races faced off to a stalemate.

By the influence of Nox the Elves decided to break the Dwarven power by destroying the World Tree which produced the Seed of the Mountain.  Its destruction would break the power of their runes.  Little did they know that the Rune Stone was not created by the Dwarves, and the destruction would bring them nothing but pain.

With the destruction of the [Tree of Bonaduic](../../../cosmology/magic/places_of_power/world_trees#tree-of-bonaduic), the Elves were able to break the lines of the Dwarven expansionists.  It was a drastic measure, long since regretted by the race, even though what followed was the blossoming of Elvin civilization.

## Quest for Healing
As the World Tree burned the earth revolted.  Stars fell from the sky as the earth shook and flooded its oceans.  The land around the tree grew barren and erupted in fire and ash.

The Dwarves fled to the south and east, across the waters and back to their homelands.  They felt ashamed for their part in the destruction of the Tree.  The Elves did not flee.  They tried to remedy their mistake and stayed close to where the Tree once stood.  Some left, scattering to the ends of the earth in order to find the other Trees and become their protectors.

## Elvin Nationalism
The war against the Dwarves had united the Elvin race and with their leaders taking on the responsibility of preventing the same mistake they made, the Elves had a new sense of purpose.

Most of the Elvin societies turned to the world, a place they had scarcely explored before.  In the ruins of their mistake, they found strongholds and groves all over Aklatoria, but still kept to themselves.

They left the locals to their own devices, sometimes offered aid when asked, but their ability to use magic had their aid in too high demand.  They closed themselves off from the world and locked the doors to their strongholds.

## The Comet of Dal M'sharn Amart
Study of the destroyed Tree began soon after the war ended.  The last remnants of Myst within its husk revealed secrets of what was to come, but understood too late by the Elvin scholars.

It is not known why the comet came, or how.  Whether it was due to the destruction of the Tree, a last attempt at revenge from a cabal of Runelords, or even the Dragons calling forth punishment for their deeds.  They called it _Dal M'sharn Amart_, The Doom-bringer of the Myst.

It struck Aklatoria in the Northern ocean, causing a tidal wave to wash over the land.  The destruction was incomparable. Cities burned and abandoned.  Peoples rushing to the hills to hide.  Aklatoria has seen no such event since. It destroyed most of what was left of both the Elvin and Dwarven civilizations that came before, and most of all records were lost.

Years passed, with the winters getting longer and colder, and soon the spring stopped coming all together. _Dal M'sharn_ had brought an eternal winter to the realms.
