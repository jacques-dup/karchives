# The Age of Seeding

After the vanishing of the Ancients, came an age where Aklatoria returned to a state of natural evolution.  It is believed that the war waged between the Neliavth and the Dragons had a devastating impact on the land and a period of healing was required.

## The Birth of the Gods
In this age the first of the gods were born.  Whether the gods were spirits deified, a new race of beings from outside the known reality or even the ancient gods of the Neliavth personified, these beings collectively poured their divine essences into the [World Trees](../../../cosmology/magic/places_of_power/world_trees) to create the [Five Seeds of Life](../../myths/seeds_of_life).

## Early History
The early races were not at all what they are today.  The were tribal, pre-historic beings with just enough sentience to flock together in groups.

The newly born gods took it upon them to lead them to greatness and revealed themselves to the scattered tribes.  Progress came, slowly at first, but soon the imbalances in power, knowledge and wealth became a strong divide between the denizens of the earth.

To follow was the [Time of Turmoil](../time_of_turmoil), also known as the God Wars.
