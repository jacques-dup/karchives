# The Long Winter
## The Black Seeding {: .subtitle }
Following the destruction of the [Tree of Bonaduic](/geography/places_of_power/world_trees#tree-of-bonaduic) the land itself revolted, bringing a cataclysm in its wake. The earth shifted and burst, seasons changed and realms became barren.  Aklatoria grew colder and colder, until everything was covered in ice for thousands of years.

## Dal M'sharn
It is not known why the comet of Dal M'sharn came, or how.  Scholars now believe the comet itself was actually the [Seed of the Deep](/history/myths/seeds_of_life#the-seed-of-the-deep), falling to the earth after being lost in the void for eons as its effect on the world was the same.

Followers of the war god [Garkash](/religion/deities/garkash) attribute the comet to their patron, detailed in the myth of the [Black Seeding](/history/myths/black_seeding).

What history tells us is that the comet brought with it a corruption like none other, twisting those it touched and spawning all manner of abominations.  The changes started slow at first, and went unnoticed as the world's attention was focused on the natural destruction around them.

But then, as the last rains fell, and the world turned to ice, the dead started to rise from their graves.  Men, Elves and Dwarves alike transformed into creatures of the _Black Blood_ - Orcs, Goblins and Trolls. Havoc reigned in the light of chaotic Nox, and the peoples of Aklatoria had to withdraw from the world to survive.

## The Retreating
As the races withdrew into their strongholds, the ice fields grew.  Less and less settlements survived outside. Even in the high walled cities, where people were usually safe from the Orc raids, resources were running low.

All of the races of Aklatoria lived for centuries in desperation, only just clinging to the edge of life and livelihood.  The time was known as _The Retreating_.  The only way to continue was through unity between races and all contributing their labours, technology and magic th the survival of all.

As the last hopes faded, the earth rested under the blanket of ice. There could be no more world scale wars, and to some extent balance was restored to the cosmos.

## The Dawning
Generations of people lived through the age of ice.  So when the snows started to melt, it was a foreign phenomenon.  But surely, in another few years it became apparent that the Long Winter had passed.

Civilization had survived.  Industry began anew and the world was ripe and full of life.  What was to follow was a time of collaboration and expansion.
