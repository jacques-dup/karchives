# The Age of the Sun
## The Dawn of Man {: .subtitle }
The Age of the Sun begins at the Dawning and hallmarks the end of [The Long Winter](/history/ages/long_winter).  It is a time of unification, progress and the common good of all.  By historic account it is the current age of Aklatoria. 

> Generations of people lived through the age of ice.  So when the snows started to melt, it was a foreign phenomenon. But surely, in another few years it became apparent that the Long Winter had passed.
>
> Civilization had survived.  Industry began anew and the world was ripe and full of life.  What was to follow was a time of collaboration and expansion.

But others had survived the _Long Winter_ too. Those of the _Black Blood_ had their minds consumed by th blood lust of their war god, and they marched in mass toward the peaceful settlements.

## The War of Cleansing
Aklatoria had less than a generation when the snows finally melted before the _Black Bloods_ rose to challenge humanity.  Orcs, Goblins, Trolls, and all manner of creatures spawned from the [Seed of the Deep](/history/myths/seeds_of_life#the-seed-of-the-deep) gathered in numbers.  They raided and pillaged the land in the name of their _Dark Lord_ [Garkash](/religion/deities/garkash) the Vengeful.

Humanity had to stand together to face the onslaught, and soon declared it an outright war. Four Elvin Lords, The Dwarf King joined by seventy War Chiefs, and the twelve Human Lords joined forces in an alliance against the _Tainted_.

With the combined might of the Alliance, the hold of the Tainted was broken.  Using the knowledge the Elves had gained after their study of the [World Trees](/geography/places_of_power/world_trees), the Alliance was able to sever the mystic link that bound the Tainted to their god's blood lust.  With the bond broken, many of the enemy forces broke rank.  Their minds one their own again, but the Taint in their blood still filled them with rage and darkness.

The Alliance marched their armies across the realms rooting out whatever remnants of the enemy remained.

## The Reclamation
The enemies scattered before the Alliance Armies.  No one was left to fight and peace finally came to Aklatoria. Everyone had seen enough war and they remembered the lessons of their past.

They went home to rebuild.  Dwarves to their mountain homes in Kalibora and the Elves to their strongholds in Kethraelm.  The rest of the races divided what remained.

## The Current Age
It is now more than six hundred years since the Last Battle of the War of Cleansing.  History is not forgotten, but the centuries of peace can soften the hearts of man.

No empire has risen from the ashes of the old.  Humans have spread across the land.  Scattered kingdoms now dot the realms and progress continues.

It is a new age with new possibilities.  A golden age filled with adventure.  The Age of the Sun.  And the dawn of a new time.
