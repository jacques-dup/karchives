# The Black Seeding
It was in the time just before the Long Winter came, when _The Vengeful One_, [Garkash](../../../religion/deities/garkash) the merciless, came forth to rekindle the hate in the hearts of men. 

The Dark Lord journeyed to the edge of space to where he found a great black pool of swirling darkness - the gate to the void.  Therein he ventured forth into the unknown and remained there for a hundred years.

He emerged from the deep in a flash of light that could be seen in the sky by all, carrying in his arms the husk of the _Black Seed_.

Tormented by the void for hundred years, the war god was spent of all his strength.  Still he cried out in triumph before flinging the _Black Seed_ toward Aklatoria.  Like a comet it sped through space and crashed down on the surface of the world.  The impact causing a great flood to circle the planet.

But the purpose of the seed was not to merely cause destruction.  It was to give life and energy to the hearts of the people.  Garkash had felt the reluctance in men's hearths.  They no longer craved for battle as before.  And the _Black Seed_ was his answer.

The [Seed of the Deep](../seeds_of_life#the-seed-of-the-deep), fermenting in the Chaos Void for untold eons, contained in it the power to taint what it touched.  The Dark Lord used it on the races of Aklatoria and birthed the_ Black Blood_ races, the _Tainted Ones_. Orcs, Goblins, Trolls, Vampires. All creatures hated by man was born from his _Black Seed_.  

The god's Blood Lust filled their hearts and he was able to command them at will. With his new army, the god of war marched against the world.
