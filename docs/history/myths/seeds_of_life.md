# The Five Seeds of Life

The Sky, the Mountain, the Moons, the River and the Deep: these are the Five Seeds of Life on Aklatoria, and all creatures have evolved from these origins.  It means that all races within a particular seed have a basic, transcendent-even-if-forgotten, physical kinship with the other races in their group.  It is best described as having an original shared ancestor in their gene pool.

> Life, has always existed, and in many forms.  But at first there were no life that was truly awakened as the ancients and their gods.  Once they were many, but Aklatoria was meant to be inherited.  It yearned to be seeded with many races.
>
> At the centre of creation stood a great Tree of Life.  As the ancients faded from history, the Tree spawned seeds to reignite the land with new blood.  Five seeds fell to the earth, each reaching a different realm.  There they sprouted and began the new cycle of life.

## The Seed of the Sky

> One seed fell under the open skies.  It basked in the openness and absorbed the heat from the sun.  It grew and grew, until it burst open in divine and magical energies, transforming the creatures of the land and granting them new life under the open sky.

The earth will rage in turmoils around the races of the Sky.  But the winds of change will bring a sense of freedom and guide its children to a new horizon.  So are the races born from the Seed of the Sky, open of heart and mind, looking to the heavens and free.

## The Seed of the Mountain

> One seed fell between the rocks of the highest mountains.  It was buried deep between the stone and roots of the world.  It grew strong and hardy under the soils, until it burst through the boulders as a mighty tree itself.  Its fruits fed the creatures from the mountainside, gave them strong wills and strong bodies to survive where others could not.

Those born from the Seed of the Mountain, are naturally inclined toward the wonders of the natural world. Born from the depths, shaped by conflicts and tempered by ancient hardships, the races seeded by the Mountains are hardy and self-inclined.  They are strong of will and body and defiant in defeat.

Its magical energies radiated into the night, pulling closer all manner of otherworldly presences. It blossomed into a giant moon-flower that fed the land with its nectar, sharing with them the secrets of the universe.

## The Seed of the River

> One seed fell to the great rivers.  It tumbled and rolled for ages in the waters, before it caught itself near a shallow pool.  There it grew, its roots stretching far under the waters.  Creatures drank from its basin and came to know its greatness.  Sheltering under its branches, they learned to tame the great rivers.  It fed them, protected them and gave them something to live for.

The great river of creation brings forth the best and the worst from mortals.  It is strong of will, a force to be reckoned with, yet ever changing and diverse.  It brings industry to the land, and contentment to the heart.  So are the races born of its seed.

## The Seed of the Deep

> The last of the seeds fell into the abyss.  Long after the other seeds had grown old, it remained in the deepest of darkness.  In the depths it drank in the void and almost lost all of its innate magics.  Then one day, seemingly out of nowhere, if fell from the void and crashed into the earth.  Corrupted and broken, its decaying bulbous body oozed onto the land.  It transformed all it touched, twisting the life created by the other seeds into horrific monsters.

A deep shadow can fall onto the land.  It curses the ground it touches, it corrupts the souls it spawns.  The races of the deep were never born from it, but rather became part of it as the darkness of the Deep set its roots into the land.
