# Ärun and The Birth of The Dwarves

> Ärun, kza dǒrrsláfǒr lurr. Myiljöran förebra undvergvardör kza. Starkenes han, det när sláfall dǒr handen, äaska ka blit lurrkza komdur etten utbryt.

From his magical forge in the clouds, the giant Ärun was known as the greatest smith in the cosmos.  He was so strong, that when he struck his anvil, it would resound across the sky and sparks would bounce off the clouds.

> Etinkzah Maakza handen. Fyrür dem gärvar dǒrrslá han. Aekgigär ekgi alle Etin elskamir Ärun. Hevngjerrig ka rambusigg komdur var dem. Guryel dem vil. Utma han ra dem. Ori utman burêl ka vergïlld kza. Svakket dem ahkur han kza.

He had friends amongst the spirits of the earth and often made gifts for them, but not all the spirits held a love for Ärun.  They were vindictive and chaotic at heart, craving destruction.  Some of the more mischievous spirits challenged his skill and strength, claiming that he could never make something of true value to them.

> Aekgigär, starkenvis Ärun'es. Dǒrith sláfall han mett starkra. Dǒrrsláfǒr Ärun eiltöfarinor, hvístär ka kivi tille välsig han. Slovax Kazunignor ro han, förebraden tille var. Etin tälentölen rögg undamhäres, hakrä, hakrä. Äater dǒrith sláfall han mett starkra. Kazunignor tälentölen ra ka var ablârul ra. Etin var smënmukr hammumul, aekgigär Etininor tälentölen rögg undamhäres, hakrä, hakrä. Äater dǒrith sláfall han mett starkra.

But Ärun was stubborn and rose up to the challenge.  For many years he worked the forge, mixing stone and steel.  He formed a hundred thousand figurines, reflections of his own strength and prowess.  It was not enough to impress the spirits, so he continued working.  When he returned the figurines could move and speak, but they were still lifeless.  Though some applauded, not all were convinced, so he went back to his forge and continued working.

> Auskivi den fjel fel unedan, han taken yanzadku. Kazunignor bilef vanvande. Kazunith Mükdverdür fönaväs.

This time Ärun took the Seed of the Life which fell beneath his mountain, the _Auskivi_, and worked it on its anvil among the stone and steel.  It started giving his figurines true consciousness. He called them _Kazundverder_, the Dwarves.

> Vanvande demes, ná tillbakra Ärun. Etin glädjaes ka han nurbêl. Ärunes tröttares, därförin han aedur sömn. Hanes lover Etinkzar, ori Sultím, ori Tungletím, dem vakir Kazunith Mükdverdü. Kza ar, ka serenlurr vasalärr.

When he returned with the living beings, the spirits rejoiced and praised him.  Exhausted from his work, Ärun went to sleep.  He made two of the spirits promise him that they will watch over his creation.  _Sultím_, the day spirit, would give them warmth and teach them to make fire.  _Tungletím_, the night spirit, would grant them pleasant dreams.

> Aekgigär förrendares. Kazunith Mükdverdü dem förslava. Ärunen Ekgiminn pvi-da Etin drek minna. Tungletím fjölkynnrar starkenes balá.

But as he slept the other spirits made plans to enslave the new Dwarves.  They sent an agent to the sleeping giant, who poisoned him as he dreamed.  The poison was meant to make him forget his creation, so that the Dwarves could serve the spirits instead.

> När vanvakenes Ärun, Kazunith Mükdverdü han ekgiminnes. Aekgigär ogsäven Etin ekgiminnes ka vil ekgiminnes. Endakunith minna dǒrrsláfǒres. Kazunith Mükdverdü eiltöfar rï-urf Etin förslava.

When he woke Ärun could not remember anything.  He had forgotten his creation, but also his friends - the spirits, and his love for the world.  The only thing that remained was his anvil and forge.  Since that day the Dwarves belonged to the spirits, and the giant worked his forge for all eternity.
