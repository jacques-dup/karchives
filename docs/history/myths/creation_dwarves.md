# The Birth of Ärun and the Dwarves

From his magical forge in the clouds, the giant Ärun was known as the greatest smith in the cosmos.  He was so strong, that when he struck his anvil, it would resound across the sky and sparks would bounce off the clouds.

He had friends amongst the spirits of the earth and often made gifts for them, but not all the spirits held a love for Ärun.  They were vindictive and chaotic at heart, craving destruction.  Some of the more mischievous spirits challenged his skill and strength, claiming that he could never make something of true value to them.

But Ärun was stubborn and rose up to the challenge.  For many years he worked the forge, mixing stone and steel.  He formed a hundred thousand figurines, reflections of his own strength and prowess.  It was not enough to impress the spirits, so he continued working.  When he returned the figurines could move and speak, but they were still lifeless.  Though some applauded, not all were convinced, so he went back to his forge and continued working.

This time Ärun took the Seed of the Life which fell beneath his mountain, and worked it on its anvil among the stone and steel.  It started giving his figurines true consciousness. He called them _Kazundverder_, the Dwarves.

When he returned with the living beings, the spirits rejoiced and praised him.  Exhausted from his work, Ärun went to sleep.  He made two of the spirits promise him that they will watch over his creation.  _Sultím_, the day spirit, would give them warmth and teach them to make fire.  _Tungletím_, the night spirit, would grant them pleasant dreams.

But as he slept the other spirits made plans to enslave the new Dwarves.  They sent an agent to the sleeping giant, who poisoned him as he dreamed.  The poison was meant to make him forget his creation, so that the Dwarves could serve the spirits instead.

When he woke Ärun could not remember anything.  He had forgotten his creation, but also his friends - the spirits, and his love for the world.  The only thing that remained was his anvil and forge.  Since that day the Dwarves belonged to the spirits, and the giant worked his forge for all eternity.
