> Tel'tel Ithelkiir ro'tel ya firvain kethiir, sharti weh Orea'del. Quar sen ent sehan'kyshuf sen arta tel'ther ath Engari. Nha sen illon ath keriath, ent dal sen dalrielle uaul daellon ath O'Kiir.

The Ancient _Ithelkiir_[^1] roamed the places between realms in the times of _Orea'del_[^2], before creation. They danced and dashed across the heavens of _Engari_[^3]. They were creatures of conflict, and they fought many great battles against the beings of the void.

> Nhara sen thehstar tel'ithelvae an iquann Nethrllana. Que firvain kethiir n'han niff ath Faenyewen, siil hasa sen lin sen avae teil tel'kethallon.

It was they who gathered the star dust to form the Peoples of the Moons, _Nethellana_. Scattered across the realms were the traces of the _Faenyewen_[^4], which enabled them to truly open their eyes and see the world.

> Nhara sen, Ithellon, Ruellon ent Daeoel. Nhara sen anorisa tel'niffel ath Tel'ques n'hasiil Drethor. Lynan dal. Lynan teshuel ru. Lynan wensan ent von ausa velmakau ent velwenta. nhara sen iquandre tel'ansrivarr dao ent ithkerfae. Niffel ra orisa an Tel'ques ath talik ent hu. Otel'ques ro kethallon ausa rathavae.

There was Ithellon[^5], Ruellon[^6] and Daeoel[^7]. They became the ones to grow the seed of the Elven people in their infancy. Birthed to do battle. Birthed to draw blood. Birthed to consume and rule with steel and teeth. They poured into their souls the memories of their adventures and of their magic. From the seed grew a people strong and free. And we roamed the lands of the World with glee and purity.
