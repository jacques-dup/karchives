## Common Worship
Opus is the Father of Nature, solemn protector of the wilds, and Keeper of the Groves.  His blessings keep the forests lush and food abundant, but also keeps the wilderness at peace so that man can live in harmonic, close proximity to it.

Father Gaia accepts all who obey his laws of temperance when within his realm, respecting all the creatures that call the forests and mountains their home, but he also lashes out at those who disturb his sanctuaries and kill his creatures without purpose.
