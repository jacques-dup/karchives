* **Type:** Major Deity (Lesser Deity)
* **Alignment:** Chaotic Good
* **Domains:** Beauty, Unity
* **Symbol:** Elegantly, swirling vine sprouting roses.
* **Followers:** Revelers, The Love-stricken, Poets and all those who enjoy the thrill of the feast.
* **Manifestation:** Manifestations of Duswyn are rare and often unproven, as his followers are usually inebriated during their enigmatic experiences. Accounts have one common theme though, and that is that Duswyn is never seen in living form.  Rather he manifests as a beautiful, athletic statue in onyx, with everlasting wine flowing from his eyes and mouth.  When consumed, his wine possesses healing properties, but instantly causes severe drunkenness.
