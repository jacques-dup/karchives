## Associated Religious Organizations

## Common Worship
Seth is called upon where rivalries turn vengeful and ambition drives decisions.  Where jealousy turns primal and hatred turns to a chaotic outburst.

Seth is feared by most, as she drives the minds of the destructive without the restrictions of law as the other vengeful divine, such as [Assador](/religion/deities/assador). And so, the day that Seth decides to drive her purpose is dreaded by all its onlookers.

But Seth is also a goddess of many blessings to those with the right ambitions and aren't afraid to venture into the morally opposed methods of her will.  But since her methods often include murder or similar action, the followers of Seth worship mostly in secret.

In societies where there are none of these moral qualms, Seth drives individualism and isolated prosperity to those with the will to power, and her high priests and priestesses enjoy the benefits of their devotion to chaos.

## Myths & Dogma
