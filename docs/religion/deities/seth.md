## Common Worship
Seth is called upon where rivalries turn vengeful and ambition drives decisions.  Where jealousy turns primal and hatred turns to a chaotic outburst.

Seth is feared by most, as she drives the minds of the destructive without the restrictions of law as the other vengeful divine, such as [Assador](../assador). And so, the day that Seth decides to drive her purpose is dreaded by all its onlookers.

But Seth is also a goddess of many blessings to those with the right ambitions and aren't afraid to venture into the morally opposed methods of her will.  But since her methods often include murder or similar action, the followers of Seth worship mostly in secret.

In societies where there are none of these moral qualms, Seth drives individualism and isolated prosperity to those with the will to power, and her high priests and priestesses enjoy the benefits of their devotion to chaos.

## Myths & Dogma
### Genesis
Seth was born in the early eons of Aklatoria, as a daughter of Nox, the eternal chaos. The Cosmic Chaos pulled forth a heavenly ball of flame from the depths of space, which came crashing down on the surface of Nox. Fire, Dust and Brimstone was flayed from her, coalescing into a great egg. Infused with the fires within, the egg circled its mother for a thousand years before it broke free of the pull and came hurtling toward the realms of Aklatoria.

Crashing down in the depths of the Seas of Shadow, there the egg incubated in the dark ocean until from it was spawned the Daughter of Nox.  Seth stepped from the deep ocean and descended on to the lands, a vision of chaos and destruction, her form wrapped in a vail of flaming torrents. Those who laid eyes on the spectacle was filled with darkness and hate in their hearts.

Her coming triggered a thousand years of turmoil on the lands as the minds of men were consumed by her influence.  It took the combined effort of many divine and their followers to pull her back to the realm of the divine. Timing and skill brought Seth to the edge of _Rot M'karrin_, what is now called _The Shadowlands_. She stood on a pinnacle rock, where the energies of the earth emanates to the Dark Realms. Aegis, in her cosmic track, moved before the light of Nox, imbuing the gods of Order with the power to remove Set from the lands of men and bring her back to the divine realms.
