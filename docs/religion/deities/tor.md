With each strike of his hammer, thunder bursts forth and lightning pierces the skies in destructive blasts. His face is solemn and grim, long locks of gold and blue flowing from his head and his beard alight with dancing sparks.  His eyes shining with blue light as he looks down upon the destruction of his powers.

### Genesis
Tor is as old as the sky itself and has always been as that which came before. He is the son of creation and the father of lightning.  In the mythical ages he wandered the heavens without purpose, slamming the clouds to create endless storms on the primordial earth.

It was [Armara](/religion/deities/armara) the Sky Mother who came to him first.  In the guise of a swan she flew to his cloud. The strange and beautiful creature intrigued the Thunder god and his storms ceased for a moment of respite. The goddess was stricken with admiration at Tor's immense strength, and turned herself back into her humanoid, Nymph form to speak to him.  Her beauty entranced Tor so, that he forgot his mindless rage.  His senses were focussed and driven to a new purpose.

Floating on his cloud, the pair conversed for days on end, and the skies cleared as never before.  They spoke as if they never spoke to any other beings before, about the sky, the sun and later the world beneath their gaze.

Invigorated with purpose the Thunder god followed Armara to the realm of the divines, to meet the other gods, to see what his new found interests may bring him.  He saw the earth and those who worshipped his name without his realization. He saw all as his eyes were blinded to the truth of the cosmos until the day the Sky goddess came to him.

Tor felt a passion in his heart.  He fell in love with his divine kin and formed strong bonds of friendship soon. He was passion, he was strength, he was the bringer of the storms on the earth. He was now home.
