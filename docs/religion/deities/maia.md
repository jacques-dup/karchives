## Common Worship
The Arcane is a daunting and mysterious force that requires not only training, but often divine guidance as well.  Whenever matters of the Arcane impacts the life of mortals, there will be the presence of Maia, as her own essence is tied to that of the Myst.

Especially when wild, unknown or strange magic is encountered, this is where the goddess is addressed most, as only she is able to tame that which is untameable and only she can subdue the unpredictable forces form the Mystrealm.

## Myths & Dogma
### Genesis
Even among the uninitiated, it is known that Maia was not born into divinity, but ascended from a once mortal form.  She began life in a time before records, one of an ancient, primitive, now long-extinct race.  Nothing is known of this race other than they were not able to tame the Myst and wield magic.  Maia sought knowledge, believing that there was more to the cosmos than what was known.  She found the single source of power, a gateway to the Myst-realm and ventured forth into the unknown.  The Myst consumed her form and she was lost for generations.  Then, almost out of nowhere, she resurfaced, now imbued with the power of the Myst and with the ability to draw power from the Ever-realms.

It is said that she fought against all manner of magical beasts and outsiders in the Myst, only surviving through sheer determination and the will to live.  The Myst gradually transformed her body as she remained in the Realm between Realms, and soon she was as much part of the Myst as that she was in it.  Seeking ways to return to Aklatoria, she found a way to bind herself to the fissure between realms.  It enabled her to step into and out of the outer plains, but also bound her as the primary conduit between the Myst-realm and Aklatoria.  She became the source of magic in the world.

Using her new-found power, she began shaping her world to better the lives of her people and soon became revered as a god by her primitive kin.  But as their civilization faded into myth, the immortal goddess knew her destiny and purpose would be far greater than being the patron of her people.  New races were born.  New entities rose to challenge and rival her powers.  She was magic, the first and true conduit, the fissure between realms, the Goddess of Arcana.
