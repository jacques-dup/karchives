## Associated Religious Organizations

## Common Worship
The Smith Lord is ever present in the forge, no matter its size nor the skill of the creator.  He is the fire that smelts and the hammer that shapes.  Even an inexperienced worker can be blessed with the talent to craft, and even those who have years of knowledge can yet to be blessed with a true masterpiece.

Those who work the metal, stone and gems often call to the Master of the Forge seeking inspiration and providence.  And those who benefit from the creations often give thanks to Madis alongside the forger.

In a number of civilizations who revere the artistry and craft of forge working, will institutionalize the worship of Manos Claye withing their guilds, and usually the crafts of these guilds are most sought after.

## Myths & Dogma
### Genesis
During the early ages in the time of the [God Wars](../../../history/ages/times_of_turmoil#the-god-ears), the warring gods along with endless mortals were tied in an endless struggle of battles and skirmishes. Whomever had the means to support their cause with powers, magic and weaponry would be the victors, or so that was the opinion of the Fire god [Ura of the Deep](../ura).  He wanted to secure his place in the divine ranks as best he could.

Throughout the ranks of the divine there was no-one who could forge arms for the gods.  All except the Mad Giant [Ärun](../../../history/myths/creation_dwarves), the one who forged the Dwarves from the [Seed of the Mountain](../../../history/myths/seeds_of_life#the-seed-of-the-mountain).  The act had caused the Giant his mind and he was therefore unable to create what the gods truly needed.

Ura proposed to the goddess [Lilith](../lilith) to bare him a son whom he can teach to control the fires, in order to make the perfect smith and therefore the perfect aid against the onslaughts of the God Wars.  Lilith agreed to the arrangement, but secretly approached the other gods for blessing of her own devising to be places upon the child.

From [Lafarn](../lafarn) she asked a blessing of independence so that the child can follow his own path, away from his father. From [Naásh Feramil](../naash_feramil)  she asked for a blessing of compassion so that he will not only use his abilities for destruction.  And from [Opus](../opus) she asked that he bless her son with an understanding of the natural order and knowledge of minerals and stones so that his crafts can be more than mere tools, but works of art formed through an innate understanding of the source.

And so, when Manos Claye was born he possessed all the ability his father intended, but to his surprise, the Great Smith was not a blind pawn in his war efforts.  Nonetheless, Ura taught him the secrets of fire and gave him command over the flames of the earth so that he can practice his trade.

Manos, grateful to his father for his teaching, and grateful to his mother for her intuitions, claimed the mantel of Master of the Forge. Weapons he did make, that much is true, but his purpose became to serve his own creativity.  He forged trinkets, jewels, arms and more.  Anything that he felt was worth the steel of the earth, he made.  And so the god of the Forge was born.
