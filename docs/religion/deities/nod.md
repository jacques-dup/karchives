## Common Worship
Nod does not enjoy much common worship. In fact knowledge of his sects and influences is far spread and even then only spoken of in whispers.

Those who know, know to fear his powers, as dabbling the writings of his followers often ends in madness. His name is spoken as a curse when faced with unknown horrors by those who know it, though doing so holds no meaning to any of his devout.

## Myths & Dogma
### Genesis[^1]

> [The Void](/cosmology/planes/void_of_creation). That is where it begins. There is no telling how far I have ventured into the Deep Unknown. The hours seem like minutes and the days... I think it has been a few years since I began, but there's no way for me to tell any more.
> 
> I need to write quickly... My mind wanders too much these days.
> 
> The Void is where he started. Something brought him from there.. I don't know what. But it was an effort to close the hole he crept from, and it only partly diminished his powers.
> 
> In the tongue of men, his name is to sleep. Apt, for his presence clouds the mind and brings nightmares of madness.
> 
> The eons before time, that is when he came. The gods fought against him, but could only make him sleep. They had not the power to overthrow the Void and what lies beyond.
