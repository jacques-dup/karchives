## Myths & Dogma
### Genesis
The origin of the Morning Lord lies far before the ages of myth, an infant god spawned from the interactions of the ancient great beings.  Coined from an excerpt of the [Book of Arath Aev](/history/artifacts/book_of_arath_aev/#book-three-the-birth-of-arath), the great orb of fire that was cut from the serpent came about to light the heavens.  As its rays stretched across the realms, with it came the potential for the life of mortals.

It is said that the first flower to sprout under the rays of the sun was an aster. And from it was born te god of the sun itself.  But the infant essence was far from the divine entity it is in the modern ages.  Taking eons to mature, it was only later when the Morning Lord was personified into his current being.

By the time mortals became aware enough of the cosmic powers that be, Lord Aster had his current manifestation, however.  His gigantic form could sometimes be seen far off on the mountains, where he used his spear to move the sun across the sky, constructing the patterns of the seasons and bringing the life-giving light to all of the world.
