Worshippers often call his name in aid against the undead, or for blessings against dark curses. Where the light of his day shines there is always hope against the odds and this who came to revere him will see that light in the darkest of places.

His spirit is most prevalent on the open plains, in the morning sun, where the flowers of his name bloom aplenty.

## Myths & Dogma
### Genesis
The origin of the Morning Lord lies far before the ages of myth, an infant god spawned from the interactions of the ancient great beings.  Coined from an excerpt of the [Book of Arath Aev](../../../history/artifacts/book_of_arath_aev/#book-three-the-birth-of-arath), the great orb of fire that was cut from the serpent came about to light the heavens.  As its rays stretched across the realms, with it came the potential for the life of mortals.

It is said that the first flower to sprout under the rays of the sun was an aster. And from it was born te god of the sun itself.  But the infant essence was far from the divine entity it is in the modern ages.  Taking eons to mature, it was only later when the Morning Lord was personified into his current being.

By the time mortals became aware enough of the cosmic powers that be, Lord Aster had his current manifestation, however.  His gigantic form could sometimes be seen far off on the mountains, where he used his spear to move the sun across the sky, constructing the patterns of the seasons and bringing the life-giving light to all of the world.

### The Lord and Lady
During the [Time of Turmoil](../../../history/ages/time_of_turmoil), an age of war and strife, Lord Aster's convictions were put to the test.  He found solace in the the words of Lady [Elmara](../elmara), who spoke with calm wisdom and elegant temperance.  With the Morninglord being a a bringer of Hope and Light to the world, he urged on the teachings of the Lady, and set his heart upon her desires.

His feelings grew as he perceived her graces. Her powerful, elegant persona fueling his desires. Soon he was entranced by her, and his infatuation became clear to all around, even the goddess herself, as more than mere reverence.  Fortunately, the Lady had set her heart upon him as well, and she returned his love in all of her heavenly glory.  As fate would have it, their union bared a child.  [Heron](../heron) had her father's strength and her mother's grace. And through her upbringing in the courts of the divine, she was destined to become a force of righteousness on Aklatoria.
