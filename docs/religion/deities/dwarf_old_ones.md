Bellan (First ones, The Forgotten, The Titans).
These old gods are ancient beings whom the Dwarves revered at the dawn of time.  They are primal, deeply magical and truly immortal.  Their existence comes from natural realities and concepts, and embody these accordingly.  Most of the old ones are now dormant, no longer influencing the world as their grip on reality fades due to lack of worship.  They still exist, but their reach and ability is limited to a single physical instance.  Scholars now claim that the Old Ones are part of an ancient race that once dominated the world.  As the lesser races came into being they found power in this domination.  Still power and magic they had, and to some extent still do.  Others believe that the Dwarven account of the _Bellan_ is quite similar to the account of the _Neliavth_ and believe the Bellan to be part of this ancient race.
