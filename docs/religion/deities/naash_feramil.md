Na치sh Feramil has many faces. Most often she will appear as a dusty-coloured cat, casually lounging in a yard.  Other times she will take the form of a slender maiden dressed in a cloth apron as if busy with house work, only her golden, catlike eyes hinting at her divine nature.  Then again at other times she will take the form of an old lady who goes around sharing food, often with the less fortunate.
