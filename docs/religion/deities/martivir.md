### Genesis
Ascended to divinity to claim the role of Judge of the Life Lived, Martivir was old even before most of the gods were born.

As a servant of Aegis, he controls the Silver Flame of Law.  The pinnacle of righteousness and paragon of justice resides outside the realm of mortals.

Zealous followers of The Dragon of Law, says one day he will come from the far skies to destroy Nox and eliminate chaos once and for all, brining tranquil peace to the hearts of all mortals, and taking away all emotion.
