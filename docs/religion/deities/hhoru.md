## Associated Religious Organizations

## Common Worship
Worshippers of the Blood god ambitiously seek to gain the power through sacrifice and spiritism. They praise the name of Hhoru in the dark places of the world by offering up sacrifices of flesh and blood, often sharing in the consumption of the sacrificial body.

Worship of Hhoru is secret, and openly proclaiming his name in the civilized corners of the realms is mostly seen as aberrant.  They are shunned for their ways and often prosecuted form mere association.

Those who do not follow the teachings of Hhoru might use his name in a curse, especially if an extreme, vindictive and malicious fate is wished upon the target of the curse.  But it is known that the Blood god will not accept any request without blood being spilt, and those who try without it will face his wrath.

## Myths & Dogma
### Genesis
Before the age of gods, many powerful spirits roamed the lands.  These creatures dominated the mortal races into worshipping them and by their primal natures they were able to harness this worship to some extent. One such an entity was determined to become the god Hhoru.

In his early form Hhoru demanded sacrifice from his subjects. Through the spilling of blood he gained presence and through consuming it he gained strength. His subjects brought him fresh kills regularly and he feasted aplenty in the early ages of the world.  Soon he became ome of the most powerful of spirits on Aklatoria.

It is not clear exactly when and how Hhoru ascended to true divinity.  But those who worship the Blood god mostly think it irrelevant. There is power to be had through sacrifice at his altar.  Though some suggest a sinister plot that led to Hhoru's ascendance.

So it is said, that during the [Age of Seeding](../../../history/ages/age_of_seeding), Hhoru had anticipated the cosmic event through a powerful blood divination. He positioned himself in anticipation and was able to intercept the [Seed of the Moon](../../../history/myths/seeds_of_life) as it fell to the earth.  His subjects lined the hills in thousands as the Seed descended and at his command ten thousand souls plunged instruments of death through their hearts, lending their life force to the Blood god.

Through the mass sacrifice Hhoru was able to withstand the magic the Seed cast over the lands.  He basked in its power and drank in the cosmic whirlpool of creation.  Through the Seed amd the blood of ten thousand, Hhoru ascended his form.  His earthly body could not withstand the forces around him and was deformed - his dark wishes guiding an abhorrent transformation, but the Blood god's mind remained, anchored to the land and spanning across the realms as it pierced the vail of creation where the Seed fell to earth.

There is power in blood.  There is more power in blood given without consent. Such is the nature and the purpose of the Blood god and the purpose of his birth.
