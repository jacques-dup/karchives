* **Symbol:** A gold cast crown encircled in runes.
* **Followers:** Knights, Nobility, Diplomats and all who believe in the honour of keeping to a unified morality.
* **Manifestation:** Elmara's form is that of an elegant Lady of Court.  Her gown shimmers with a thousand colours, her skin glowing, alabaster, smooth and decorated.  Lace and feathers coupled with gems and pearls wrap her body, subtly twinkling in a graceful chime as she walks.  Her eyes are covered in an emerald mask, emphasizing her striking, ice-blue eyes and her heir is tightly woven into an elegant braid, turned up to reveal her slender neck.  When she speaks, her words flow like water over cobbles and all who hear are in awe of her beautiful wisdom.

## Associated Religious Organizations

## Common Worship
The Lady is worshiped across the realms by all who walk the halls and courts of civilization.  Her essence is the pinnacle of diplomatic grace, elegance and royalty.  As such she is revered by kings and queens, and servants of the throne alike.

Her guidance is often called for when empires meet each other in negotiations, especially when there is tension between the parties.

Although featuring less amongst the worship of the commoners, she will most often be prayed to wherever a situation desires patience or temperance.  There she will not be regarded for her elegant royalty, but rather for her intuitive ability to diffuse conflict.

## Myths & Dogma
### Genesis
Elmara was born into divinity, like most other gods, during the [Age of Seeding](/history/ages/age_of_seeding/#the-birth-of-the-gods). She came to be along side [Lilith](/religion/deities/lilith), the goddess of Beauty, as her peer and counterpart. She matched the promiscuous goddess in beauty and her words carried the same command, but Elmara preferred to convince others through their own desires instead of dominating them with her wiles.

The rivalry between the two goddesses grew as Elmara gained many followers amongst the living. Lilith challenged Elmara, saying that the only reason why mortals followed her so fervently was because of her beauty, and not her wisdom.  Without her picturesque features, she would never hold as much passion in the hearts of men.  ELmara rose to the challenge, and approached the mindless giant [Ärun](/history/myths/creation_dwarves) to craft a mask for her. The creature was one with the forge and had no other desire than to work his forge, but in the presence of the Lady a sense of recognition came over the giant.  He heard her request, and promised to forge for her a mask of emerald, if she promised to visit him every thousand years so that he can experience the clarity of mind to create once more.

ELmara vowed to Lilith that she will never again take off the mask, to prove that her followers were not under the influence of her beauty.  But it just so happened that Ärun the giant, with his mind restored, had created the most magical of artifacts, enhancing the goddess's beauty ten fold. Her presence commanded obedience even more than before.  Lilith was in awe and craved to have the Giant make the same for her, but Ärun was again his mindless self, hammering his anvil without recognition.

Elmara decided that her presence would not determine or skew her intentions however, and decided to leave the petty rivalry behind.  She could use her influence and power to truly serve the realm of the divine and that of the mortals, promoting unity and bringing out the best in everybody.  It was at that moment, that the goddess became to personify her portfolio as diplomat of the gods.

### The Lord and Lady
Through the course of the ages, there came a time of seemingly unending strife.  It was named the [Time of Turmoil](/history/ages/time_of_turmoil), and age known for many wars, the dawn of many races and the extinction of others.  During this time, Elmara took it upon herself to be a voice of reason, urging on all those who felt the impact os Chaos.

It was in this time that the Lady fist layed eyes upon the glorious Lord of the Flowers, the Lightbringer and Voice of Hope.  It was [Lord Aster](/religion/deities/lord_aster) in which she placed her trust and to whom she entrusted the future of all mankind.  He stood before the forces of darkness, clad in shining armour, with his spear in hand, speaking words of courage and unyielding conviction to those around to hear.

Her faith turned to love and then to desire as she looked upon the Morninglord in this age.  The desire was mutual and their union was blessed.  Elmara was with child and gave birth to a daughter. [Heron](/religion/deities/heron) had her father's strength and her mother's grace. And through her upbringing in the courts of the divine, she was destined to become a force of righteousness on Aklatoria.
