Ura often takes on the form of a Fire Giant, although this is not his true form. It is said that his body s perpetually engulfed in flame, so much so that it is impossible to decern any of his features.  The living flame form is small in stature, almost ape like, and tendrils of white fire flows from him as appendages. Some claim to have seen him in the deepest places of the earth, where he bathes in the lava pools of the deep underground.

## Common Worship
The fire god is worshipped by all who understand the power of flame, what it means for survival, but also that it cannot be tamed by any save the Deep One himself.  What mortals can accomplish through magic or construct is a mere reflection of the power he possesses.

Wherever fire rages and people are in danger, calls will be made to Ura to slow his flames. He is a god of destruction, but does not set out to claim the souls fo the living like other gods.  Also, amongst his followers are those who call on the flame to punish their oppressors and rivals, but usually not to claim life, rather to destroy surroundings and create setbacks.

## Myths & Dogma
### Genesis

## The Birth of Manos Claye
During the early ages in the time of the [God Wars](/history/ages/times_of_turmoil#the-god-ears), Ura proposed to [Lilith](/religion/deities/lilith) that she bare him a son.  He wanted to teach his offspring to control the fires, in order to make the perfect smith and therefore the perfect aid against the onslaughts of the God Wars.

Lilith agreed to the arrangement.  However, when the child child was borne he had a sense of independence that could not be tamed by the Fire god - an influence from his mother.  He did however surpass all expectations and had a natural aptitude for creation. Ura taught him the secrets of fire and thus was ascended [Manos Claye](/religion/deities/manos_claye), Master of the Forge.
