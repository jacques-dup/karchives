## Myths & Dogma
### Genesis
Heron was born in the early days of the [Time of Turmoil](/history/ages/time_of_turmoil), and rose to power in full during the God Wars of the age.  It is said that she was birthed from a union of the [Morning Lord](/religion/deities/lord_aster) and [Lady Elmara](/religion/deities/elmara) during this time.  As a child goddess, she played amongst the ruins of battle and learned to know the world as an unjust and cruel place.

As she grew, she asked her father why the world was so unjust. _"For in a world of the unjust, there are good men doing nothing"_, the Morning Lord replied.  She asked her mother, then, why the people of the world did nothing against the evils of the day. _"For there are no one to stand and lead them"_, the Lady said with a sigh.

Heron grew strong during those days.  Ever more being met with the bitterness of the living realms.  Ever more seeing the destruction her fellow divine caused upon the world. With her growing strength, came the realization that she herself could be the banner bearer for the unavenged.  She could be the one who leads the fight against the unjust.

And so the goddess was born into true divinity, when she picked up the mantel of protecting the weak.  She brought retribution to those who defiled the virtues of honour, brought valor to the hearts of men and brought down the hand of poetic retribution against those who oppressed the weak.
