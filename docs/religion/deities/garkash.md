## Common Worship
Garkash is the god of the Tainted, and in particular Orcs who still live by the bloodlust of their natures, revere Garkash in glory and sovereign power. His name now used, is from his original Orcish title, part of a dialect lost for many ages.

But his worship is not limited to the tainted, however, as the kin spawned from the [Seed of the Deep](../../../history/myths/seeds_of_life/#the-seed-of-the-deep) are merely the end result of the War-god's efforts to cosmic domination.

Garkash is called on to bless onslaught abd battle, where moral codes have no footing. In the rage of battle there is only death and to be the one dealing it is preferred. Such is the blessing of Hound of the Deep.

## Myths & Dogma
### Genesis
In the times before time, Garkash was was a Master of Hounds. He roamed the primordial realms a giant, calling canine beast to his call for the hunt. He himself was to the likeness of the Hound, as he was more beast than divine.

His war pack grew strong in these days, as the Master had no care for weakness. He battled against the beings of the ancient times, mastering the battle rage that guides claw and tooth. His only joy and purpose was in the taste of blood and the life leaving his prey.

By the [Times of Turmoil](../../../history/ages/time_of_turmoil), Garkash had grew in his great strength and was a force to be reckoned with. He thrived in the wars of the time and his influence grew along with his own desires. It was there that he found the knowledge of the Lost Seed, the Seed of the Deep, and he knew that it would bring fulfillment to his ambition.

Blindly forcing his way into the Void, he became the progenitor of the [Black Seeding](../../../history/myths/black_seeding)[^1]. It is said that his experience in the Void was where he truly become divine as his cosmic desires was ripped from his cosmic purpose, and the War god became purposefully aware.

[^1]: The Black seeding is part of the Mythic History of Aklatoria and its truth cannot be verified 100%.
