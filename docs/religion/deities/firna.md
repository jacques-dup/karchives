### Genesis
At the dawn of time, as far back as the oldest races can remember, the world was caught in an age of darkness un unknowing.  It was in this dark times where two daughters were born of Nox, the eternal realm of Chaos.  One child had ebony skin and embodied the darkness that follows when Chaos is let loose.  The other had skin of gold and a tongue of silver, embodying the essence of Chaos as seen in the realm of Law.

The first child, was Firna the Black.  Together with her sister, they ascended to rule the shadowy underbelly of the divine, and their influence soon extended to the realm of mortals.
