## Common Worship
There are a number of cultures who value the art of secret killing.  In such places, Firna can be worshipped in open sight, her temples a place to ask for blessings whenever sinister actions are planned.

In other places, where the act of murder goes against the morality of the people, Firna's temples can still be seen, though in much less grandeur.  Here people can come to pay tribute to the goddess in order to gain her favour and protection against her divine agents.

## Myths & Dogma
### Genesis
At the dawn of time, as far back as the oldest races can remember, the world was caught in an age of darkness un unknowing.  It was in this dark times where two daughters were born of Nox, the eternal realm of Chaos.  One child had ebony skin and embodied the darkness that follows when Chaos is let loose.  The other had skin of gold and a tongue of silver, embodying the essence of Chaos as seen in the realm of Law.

The first child, was Firna the Black.  Together with her sister, they ascended to rule the shadowy underbelly of the divine, and their influence soon extended to the realm of mortals.

Firna embodied shadow itself, and the dangers that lurks in the darkness.  Wherever she went, death followed and soon all the other divine began to avoid her for fear of her shadow.  But Firna was ever longing for the darkness and death. She looked toward the cosmic heavens and saw the [Great Void](/cosmology/planes/void_of_creation) at the edge of space and time.  There, she thought, she could find the true nature of darkness, and learn the secrets of true nothingness.

She left the realm of the real, stepping through the Black Vortex, and disappeared from existence for a brief moment.  The Void burned at her essence and she fell from the sky in a blazing inferno, screaming in agony.  She frantically grasped at the embrace of her Shadow realm, in order to hide from what she saw in the Void.  For a moment in history, the goddess cast no presence over the realms of either the divine or the mortals, her screams slowly dying to sobs, and then only a soft whimpering wail, is the wind on a starless night.

Firna returned from her hiding place, but her body was no more.  Her eyes had seen secrets beyond the vail of the Void.  She was now shadow itself.  No longer did she crave unending destruction, as her Chaos-born Mother and Sister.  She was content to lay in waiting, feasting in the systematic, deaths of those too young to die.  Her trail became that of darkness, and her methods became sinister and subtle.  She embraced Murder and Assassination over the raging death of hundreds.  It was so, that the goddess was truly born.
