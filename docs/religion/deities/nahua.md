## Common Worship
There are many who believe that the only way to ensure good crop and prosperity, a tribute should be given to the god of famine and pestilence.  They offer up a portion of their yield at the altar of Nahua to appease him and his vermin and have them stay away from their lands.

But more commonly, Nahua is regarded with fear and is to be avoided.  Vermin is seen as his foothold on the land, his eyes and ears in the realms of mortals.The creatures are killed and eradicated in fear that the god of Disaster gain too much power in their lands and is able to summon forth true disaster.

## Myths & Dogma
### Genesis
Before the age of gods, many powerful spirits roamed the lands.  These creatures dominated the mortal races into worshipping them and by their primal natures they were able to harness this worship to some extent. Nahua was among these entities in that time, a shape shifter and beast-speaker with the ability to talk to vermin.  He used this ability to threaten the ancient mortals with plague and pestilence.

As the ages progressed Nahua became one with the creatures of his will. To some extent he cared for them and they for him.  He grew tired of the company of the other spirits and pestering the mortals gave him no more pleasure.  It was then when he turned toward the deep underground, looking for new sport to entertain him in his immortality.

The unknown deep was vast and silent in those times, and soon Nahua began to fear that he would forever be lost in the caverns below.  As he was about to give up all hope, he found a chamber in the lost caverns.  Inside it was a darkness seeping through the vail between planes.  Tendrils of death reached out to him from the vortex and the Spirit recoiled.  But his curiosity drove him back again, stepping closer to the dark embrace of the Void.

Nahua called on his vermin to flood the chamber and feed the tendrils of death.  Day by day he moved closer to the vortex, continuously running scores of his pets into it.  After many days he was close enough to feel the essence of whatever lied beyond flow over him.  His mind filled with images and primal memories from the times before creation.  It is unknown how long Nahua sat there, feeding the vortex and bathing in it's darkness.  After a while he himself was unsure if his mind was still his own.

When he emerged from the deep the world had changed. The land and peoples reformed to something new.  Gods were born and Nahua saw war and suffering everywhere his eyes fell. He did not know how long he was caught in the Deep, but when he looked upon the destruction, he was filled with a maddening pleasure.  He could feel the world at his feet as if everything around him was connected to his will.  He was made new in the Deep, bu the tendrils of the void.  He was ascended.

### The first Vampire
It is told that long ago there lived a noble lord in a land which name has been lost to the ages.  He was kind and beloved by his people, intelligent and successful in his conquests.  The lord is said to be one of Caine, a line that is no more.

The lord had a beautiful wife, told to have been blessed by both [Lilith](/religion/deities/lilith) in her beauty and [Heron](/religion/deities/heron) in her strength.  But through a curse from one of his rivals, the Lady was stricken with an incurable disease that had her rot away before his eyes.

The lord spared no expense, summoning healers and sages from all the world to help him save his wife.  As all hope was lost, the Lord found it again with the _Order of the Grotto_.  He was approached by one of the sect's most powerful clerics, who hinted at the powers the Rat god gained by reaching to the Deep Void.  Out of options and drained from years of desperation, the Lord Caine ventured with the cleric to the sanctum of Nahua, where he was allowed to study the dark ceremonies and secret tomes in search of a cure. The price was his own life, as dictated by the Order.

But the lord was on the verge of madness already, and as he studied the secrets before him he was consumed by the presence of Nahua.  He found the scriptures he needed, but only after years of maddened seeking and no way of knowing that his wife had long since passed.  Without hesitation the Lord performed the darkest of rituals in the inner sanctum of Nahua.  His soul was ripped from his body in an awful transformation.  He became filled with the bloodlust of the damned as his soul was replaced with a piece of Nahua's essence.

The lord rushed back to his beloved. When he realized that she was no longer alive, and that he was lost in his mad search for years, he was overcome with a blind rage.  Within minutes the damned lord slaughtered all his subjects, ripping out their throats with his teeth and clawing out their hearts. He burst forth in a swarm of bats and rushed across his kingdom. As he slaughtered his people, his hunger slowly sated, but bu the time he was able to stop his rampage, half the kingdom lay at his feet as corpse.

It is believed, at least by those who know the will of Nahua, that this Lord Caine was the first of the damned, the Prince of Darkness, the Chosen of Nahua.
