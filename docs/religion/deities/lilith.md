Lilith manifests in female form, naked and breathtakingly beautiful.  Her presence casts an aura of charm and influence around her, bringing all mortals under her control.

The body feels the effect of her, but the mind is obfuscated.

## Associated Religious Organizations

## Common Worship
Lilith is seduction, infatuation and desire.  Wherever passions rise, there she is to fuel the flame.

Worshippers of the goddess frequent her houses, where all the primal, natural urges of mortality are embraced and celebrated.  But even more than that, it is Lilith who blesses the young to fall in love, and the wedding bed to be fruitful.  She understands that earthly desires is required for generations to follow and for the world to evolve with it.

Unfortunately, wherever men and woman are unfaithful, it is often Lilith who takes the blame, as her influence knows no bounds.  But often things can be set right if Lilith can bless the right combination of love potions and magical trinkets to seal the reunion.

## Myths & Dogma
### Genesis
Before the ages of mortals, when the cosmos was still young and titans roamed the lands of Aklatoria, Gaia gave birth to her first daughters.  Among these entities was the first maiden, named Lilith. Her being was not of the divine, but of the essence of nature itself, immortal and changing.  She was one with the earth and its creatures and cared for them as a mother would care for her children.

Through the eons before counting, Lilith grew more beautiful by the year.  She met with other entities, including the divine on a regular basis, and her beauty enticed them to grant her favours and blessings.  She grew to appreciate the attention her beauty brought her.

As the world evolved through its pre-historic ages, Lilith grew excited at the progress of it. But suddenly and out of nowhere, all her subjects mysteriously disappeared from the face of Aklatoria.  It was a time know as _The Vanishing_. She searched the realms for a reason for _The Vanishing_ but could find none.  Instead, she found that in the wake of _The Vanishing_, mysterious orbs of power was left behind on Aklatoria. It was the beginning of the [Age of Seeding](../../../history/ages/age_of_seeding), and the dawn of the gods.

Lilith followed one such orb, the [Seed of the River](../../../history/myths/seeds_of_life#the-seed-of-the-river) to where if fell on the plains.  She drank in its essence and was born anew as a true divine being.

## The Contest between Lilith and Elmara
Not long after ascending to divinity, Lilith met her match in beauty.  Her rival was [Elmara](../elmara), the goddess of diplomacy and nobility.  Where Elmara's beauty was elegant and graceful, Lilith's was primal and infatuating.

Lilith saw that Elmara had many followers among the mortals already, and saw that they were as infatuated with Elmara as they were with herself.  She told Elmara that the true power over the mortal realm was through their intoxicating beauty, and not through their actions or words.  Lilith understood the primal nature of the creatures of the earth, for she lived among them for eons.

Elmara was not convinced, however, so Lilith challenged her to cover her face in a mask for the next generation of mortals, to see if she still held the same sway over them.  Elmara accepted the challenge and enlisted the services of a mad giant [Ärun](../../../history/myths/creation_dwarves) to create the mask. The creature was driven mad when he created the Dwarven race, overextending his powers.  Through some fluke, however, the Giant was able to create for Elmara a powerful emerald mask that magically enhanced her beauty even more.

Lilith was shocked at the outcome and wished for Ärun to do the same for her, but the giant was back to his mindless self and could not comply. The rival goddesses decided that their competition was over.  Each application of their beauty had merits.  Elmara would use hers to entice change in the hearts of the mortals, and Lilith chose that hers would be used to enflame their passions.

## The Birth of Manos Claye
During the early ages in the time of the [God Wars](../../../history/ages/times_of_turmoil#the-god-ears), [Ura](../ura) proposed to Lilith that she bare him a son.  He wanted to teach his offspring to control the fires, in order to make the perfect smith and therefore the perfect aid against the onslaughts of the God Wars.

Lilith agreed to the arrangement, but secretly approached the other gods for blessing of her own devising to be places upon the child.

From [Lafarn](../lafarn) she asked a blessing of independence so that the child can follow his own path, away from his father. From [Naásh Feramil](../naash_feramil)  she asked for a blessing of compassion so that he will not only use his abilities for destruction.  And from [Opus](../opus) she asked that he bless her son with an understanding of the natural order and knowledge of minerals and stones so that his crafts can be more than mere tools, but works of art formed through an innate understanding of the source.

And so son of Ura and Lilith was born.  She named him [Manos Claye](../manos_claye) and he became the Master of the Forge.
