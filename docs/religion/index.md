# Gods & Religion
## Gods, Churches, Sects & Secrets {: .subtitle }
> Beliefs have always played a great role in culture and the formation of societies.  In a realm where unknown magic dominates the cosmos, it is only fitting that religion plays a key role in the ordering of society.

Aklatoria is predominantly Polytheistic, potentially having hundreds of different gods and even more sect and churches.  At its most common, inhabitants believe in all the listed major deities, whereas in other places, you might find the influence of only some.  The god-lore of the realm is best described in a layered approach, where each layer represents a philosophical ethos surrounding gods and religion.

??? abstract "Belief Types"
    1. **Common Ethos: Polytheistic Pantheons:** _There are many gods who are raised above mortals and hold much power._
    2. **Verdant Ethos: Animism:** _Everything has a divine essence._
    3. **Seclusion Ethos: Tight Pantheons:** _What we believe is the truth, the others are sacrilegious._
    5. **Scientific Ethos: Truth Seekers:** _Even the gods do not know everything... There are greater powers and rules governing the cosmos..._

## Divine Source
That which makes a being divine is an essence known as Divine Source.  It is a remnant of the same energies that created the universe, limited to some extent as a resource, but foundational to the existence of the cosmos. Some creatures gain special characteristics for just being in the proximity of a Powerful Divine Source. And those who become it's conduit, become true gods.

??? abstract "Divine Beings and Rank"
    1. **Divine Outsider:** Entities native to the divine realms are the least powerful type of divine being. These include angels, demons and devils native to Aegis, Nox and the Myst realm.
    2. **Immortals:** There are some beings who are born outside of time and bloodlines of the outer planes. These are known as immortals. Though they do not whither by age, they can be killed by other means. They may be born of any plane or realm, but are rare and hard to identify.
    3. **Dragons:** Notably powerful, perhaps a little more so than Immortals as they are born of one of the first and most pure Divine Sources, are the Dragons.
    4. **Titans:** There are beings in this world, similar to the immortals, but who possess a small manner of Divine Source Power. These are known as Titans and they typically have been alive since the dawn of creation. They vary in form and rarely have a consciousness tied to the inner cosmic planes.
    5. **Demigods:** Beings who become conduits or vessels for Divine Source, gain with it special powers. Their worship and tributes fuel their powers, but usually in a very limited region or manner. Such entities are known as Demigods.
    6. **Lesser Deities:** Those entities who's Divine Source becomes self-sustaining without the need for constant tribute are known as Deities, and those Deities who hold no major, cosmic portfolio are known as Lesser Deities. They are not diminished in power compared to their kin, but rather their classification refers to their domains of power.
    7. **Major Deities:** Those Deities with major portfolios, who have no dependence on worship to remain powerful, are known as Major Deities.
    8. **Elder Beings:** The common Polytheistic Ethos of Aklatoria acknowledges that none of the Major Deities known to the world has created it. It is therefore believed that there is a Divine Source above them, though it has never been proven. These ultimate Sources are referred to as Elder Beings.
