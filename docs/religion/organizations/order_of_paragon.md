# The Paragons of the Erigrim
## The Pantheon of Dwarven Ancestry {: .subtitle }

!!! info "Details"
    **Type:** Verdant Ethos: Polytheistic, Animism

    **Patron Deity:** The [Erigrim](/religion/deities/erigrim)

## Worshippers:
Dwarves, for most accounts, revere all their ancestors as the guardians of creation.  They believe that all who die, may become part of the fires that fuel the _Eternal Forge_, and all (Dwarven) souls, still have a part to play in the workings of the world even after they die.  But from their own legends and mythical history the Erigrim (Literally: the Elders who are eternal) stand at the forefront of religious following.

These are ancient ancestors who reached divine status by banishing the primal [Old Gods](/religion/deities/dwarf_old_ones) from the **Azthin** (Literally: Rock and Earth, time of the Stones.  Refers to the Material Plane) and teaching the Dwarven race the power of Runes.  It was they who granted the clans the power to slay dragons and who enabled the Dwarves to flourish as the greatest empire the world had ever seen during the _Age of Stone_.

## Priesthood: 
Those dedicated to the divinity of their ancestors may choose to become part of the priesthood as a cleric or a paladin of the Dwarven Ethos. According to custom, they may take any patron.  They see servitude to a god as noble and a very personal act. Others choose to serve all the Erigrim equally.

Typically a priest will choose to serve a patron akin to his/her own skills and talents. Smiths, for example, would revere _Bazardin_, and soldiers _Fallarn_ or _Gort_. Based on their choice the cleric is marked with the rune of his patron or patrons.

The only exception is that of _Durathor_. No honorable Dwarf will openly choose the _Gray god_ as their patron. Though he is acknowledges and revered to some extent, as the Martyr who sacrificed all to have the Elders ascend. But now he stands as the antithesis to what all Dwarves strive to be.

### Hierarchy

??? abstract "Clerical Ranks"
    1. **Hammerguard.** (Vakir Myiljagür) Those who join the ranks of the Kazmukzakällen, begin as Hammerguards.  They are the soldiers of the Order and enjoy the respect of all Dwarves.
    2. **Goldshield.** (Nürr'eSkyd ) Captains of the army are granted a golden shield and become known by that name.
    3. **Rune-blessed.** (Vitkyvälsigna) When one of the Order shows a talent for leadership, they can be given the rank of Runeblessed and are gifted arms from the smiths of Bazardin. They are the banner bearers of the Order.
    4. **Paragon.** (Förebra) Great deeds of virtue, as sacrificial devotion, the forging of an artifact or unyielding perseverance in battle can have a priest regarded as Paragon.  They are seen as living saints and to be aspired to. Their family gains noble status and are immortalized in the Halls of Lore.
    5. **Elderkin.** (Kazunfärr) As the Paragons of the Kazmukzakällen grow in wisdom and their leadership through unflinching faith is proven time and time again, they might be considered Elderkin. Though the church rarely involve themselves in the politics of the nobility, the King of Agamoria himself will be hard pressed to refuse the council of an Elderkin, let alone oppose his word.
