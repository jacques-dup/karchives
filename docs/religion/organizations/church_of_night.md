# Church of Night
## The Order of Assador {: .subtitle }

* **Type:** Seclusion Ethos: Polytheistic
* **Patron Deity:** Assador

## Worshippers
The followers of the Church of Night are often looked on in disdain.  They are seen as doomsayers and ignorant to most uninitiated.  Where operating in the open, they are often shunned for their practical interpretation if the Laws of The Fallen One, as spreading suffering is interpreted pragmatically.

Rumours are wide-spread, however, stating that the Church of Night has a secret ranking within the order.  Members are initiated through extreme and grotesque rituals, with the primary aim to bring forth more suffering onto the individuals - for their own enlightenment, as the Dark Lord revels in it, but also for the purposes of expanding the dominion of Loss.

## Priesthood
For the most part, the clergy of Assador acknowledge the existence of other deities, but see them as diluted in their essence, power and being.  Only Assador has read the [The Scroll of Creation](/cosmology/magic/mythical_artifacts/scrolls_of_creation), and only he has experienced the power of the the [Thirteen Seals](/cosmology/magic/mythical_artifacts/thirteen_seals_of_being) first hand.  As such, Assador is of higher standing in withing the cosmos, and his will is therefore superior to all other beings.

To be considered an initiate, one must not only have had to experience great loss, but also inflict it.  They are enlisted into a local cell, called a Chapter.  All members remain secret apart from a member Disciple, and an overseeing Vizier.  During gatherings, all members wear elaborate masks to hide their identities. Only when the initiate attains the rank of Disciple herself is the other members revealed.

Once initiated the individual is assigned a church sigil according to their talents

* **Sigil of Incubus** clerics are charismatic leaders.  They are chosen for their ability to influence others through their conviction and fervour.  These agents form the public branch of the church.
* **Sigil of Bile** clerics are unflinching in the face of tragedy.  They are chosen for their ability to inflict pain and enforce the Law of Loss.  These agents are often seen as sociopaths.  Also called the Army of the Fallen, they are warriors fighting for the will of the church.
* **Sigil of Blood** clerics are subtle an unflinching in their approach to inflicting suffering.  Their true identities are secret, even to most within the order and can usually only be identified by other blood sigil bearers.  They are the inquisitors and often assassins of the church.
