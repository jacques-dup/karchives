# The Cult of the Black Cloud
## Worshippers of Madness {: .subtitle }

!!! info "Details"
    **Type:** Scientific Ethos: Secluded Enlightened

    **Patron:** [Nod](../deities/nod)

## Worshippers:
All worshippers of Nod are part of the priesthood, and knowledge of the sect is guarded from the outside world. To become one is to embrace madness as a blessing from the Void.

## Priesthood:
Those who seek the truth of the cosmos are led to the [Void at the edge of Space](../../../cosmology/planes/void_of_creation), and unraveling the mysteries of it is a journey into madness. Mortal minds are unable to comprehend the expansive truths beyond it.

These seekers follow the trail to the Cult of the Black Cloud and are presented with the overwhelming presence of the Elder Darkness. It is there where they accept the truth, where they let go of their own earthly minds, and become one with the will of the Black CLoud itself.

### Beliefs And Dogma
Followers of Nod see madness as a privilage in a sense. The deranged are most often killed if they pose a threat to the Cult, though, but it is done out of pragmatism, not spite. For the deranged mind is a sign that the Void has revealed some truth of the cosmos to the individual.

### Prophesies
It is written, that the Void shall reveal the Time of the Coming to the High Priests of Nightmares. The Cult will grow larger in these days, bolstering the blessings of the One Who Sleeps. Through their wisdom, they will summon the Black CLoud itself to the surface of the earth. Breaking open the Void beyond, and flooding the world with Madness.

### Hierarchy

??? abstract "Clerical Ranks"
    1. **Seeker.** Those who are in the process of unravelling the mysteries of Nod are Seekers. They are at the start of their journey and the Cult is still to reveal themselves to them.
    2. **Enlightened.** Those who become part of the cult after they have discovered their truths become the Enlightened of the Cult. They are kept secure from the outside world in secret holds, where more of Nod's truth is revealed to them over time. It is a slow process for the knowledge of the Void will destroy the minds not ready for it.
    3. **Witness.** Some clergy venture into the Deep, where they stare into the Void. If they emerge, they are sanctified, unholy Witnesses to the face of Nod himself and their words speak the truth of the Black Cloud.
    4. **High Priest of Nightmares.** Those witnesses who are not soon driven to madness become High Priests or Priestesses of the Black Cloud. Only one in a few generations ever gain this rank. They may lead the Cult into the open in times where The Coming is near, when the Black Cloud can be summoned.
