# Dwarven Religious Ancestry
## The Beliefs of the Dwarven Pantheon {: .subtitle }

* **Type:** Verdant Ethos: Polytheistic, Animism
* **Patron Deity:** The Erigrim

## Common Worship and General Knowledge:
Dwarves, for most accounts, revere all their ancestors as the guardians of creation.  They believe that all who die, may become part of the fires that fuel the _Eternal Forge_, and all (Dwarven) souls, still have a part to play in the workings of the world even after they die.  But from their own legends and mythical history the Erigrim (Literally: the Elders who are eternal) stand at the forefront of religious following.

These are ancient ancestors who reached divine status by banishing the primal [Old Gods](/religion/deities/dwarf_old_ones) from the **Azthin** (Literally: Rock and Earth, time of the Stones.  Refers to the Material Plane) and teaching the Dwarven race the power of Runes.  It was they who granted the clans the power to slay dragons and who enabled the Dwarves to flourish as the greatest empire the world had ever seen during the _Age of Stone_.

According to Dwarven custom, they may take any patron.  They see servitude to a god as noble and a very personal act.  But many choose one of the Erigrim as their personal patron.  Others choose to serve all the Erigrim equally and there are even those who serve other deities completely, yet still revere the Erigrim in their own right.

Some schools of thought say that because the Erigrim were once only mortals, that they arenâ€™t true gods, yet still revere them as demigods.  Others believe that the Erigrim are the chosen gods of all Dwarves.

Still all believe that the Erigrim must be regarded with the utmost respect and love, for they are all that Dwarf-kind strives to be.
