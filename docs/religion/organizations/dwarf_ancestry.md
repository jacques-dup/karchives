#  Dwarf Ancestry
## The Ethos of Elder Worship {: .subtitle }

!!! info "Details"
    **Type:** Verdant Ethos: Polytheistic, Animism

    **Patron Deity:** Various, and The [Erigrim](/religion/deities/erigrim)

## Worshippers:
All Dwarves may choose any deity as a patron, but all of them revere their deified elders, the _Kazmukzak√§llen_, to some extent.

Choosing to serve a deity is seen as one of the most honorable acts a Dwarf can take. The commitment and sacrifice to a greater order is applauded, as the Erigrim are but one divine order in the cosmos.

Still, throughout the lands, one will find small shrines or chapels in the houses and districts where the Dwarves reside, that revere the Erigrim - their Ancestor gods, with proud indulgence.

## Priesthood: 
Those who choose to dedicate themselves to the Erigrim, form part of the [Order of Paragon](/religion/organizations/order_of_paragon) 

Those who choose other patrons follow the tenants of that organization, with the added association of Dwarf Ancestry wherever possible. Their power, however come from their patron and the Erigrim play no role in their life other than an acknowledgement of heritage.
