# The Order of the Sentinel
## The Church of Armara {: .subtitle }

!!! info "Details"
    **Type:** Common Ethos: Polytheistic

    **Patron:** [Armara](/religion/deities/armara)

## Worshippers:
The global followers of Armara, regardless of culture or creed, are the Sentinels of the goddess. They are the Vigilant that guard against the withering on life and the instillers of renewal across the realms.

Those who follow the goddess follow the way of healing, by herb, potion, spell or skills. Her teachings guide the devout and instill in them the patience and steadfast wisdom, to be able to refine their crafts and cultivate their compassion.

Having a verdant genesis, her temples dot the wilderness as beacons of hope and places of refuge. But her followers, like the wind blowing across the heavens, tend to roam as the eagles do.

## Priesthood:
Being initiated into the ranks of the Sentinels, one must be a proven healer. Usually a devout herbalist or spiritual healer would refer apprentices to join the church, as their methods are established over centuries and their wisdom remains a priceless commodity.

Initiates are then sent on a pilgrimage to one of the many sky temples of Armara. The journey usually takes a few months, as these temples are built atop the highest mountains and far away form civilization. Through the trials of the trek, the apprentice is tested in mind and body, and only though determination and perseverance do they reach their journey's end.

The temple will present their own challenges, each pertaining to the individual. The goddess knows her followers and choose their trials to suit and test the individual on their own merits. These tend to challenge them on their weaknesses, to provide a platform for personal growth.

Once the apprentice is accepted by the Sentinels of the Temple, they are free to leave as full members, or to stay for further teaching, though they do return every few years in order to renew their spirits and see if the Sentinels think them to have progressed to a new title within the Order.

### Beliefs And Dogma
The followers of the goddess roam free under the sky as the birds that serve the Mother herself. Healing and renewal of life are required everywhere across Aklatoria, and the goddess needs her agents to bring her instauration to those who need it. Though it is good to nest in one place, the winds Armara brings can shift and change, calling her followers to different places and to resist is to become like the trees instead of the roost.

### Hierarchy

??? abstract "Clerical Ranks"
    1. **Apprentice.** Those who undertake the pilgrimage to the Sky Temples are known as Apprentices, though it is common for them to already be accomplished healers.
    2. **Swallow.** The Swallows are those who are free to roam, and is the first rank of the Order. The sigil of the Swallow is adorned on their clothes to be worn with pride.
    3. **Finch/Crow.** Once the cleric gains the ability to cure disease by means of prayer, they are granted a new title based on their gender. The priestesses become _Finches_, and the priests _Crows_. Women are encouraged to wear the bright colours of their namesakes, and the men wear black robes.
    4. **Starling/Sparrowhawk** As the cleric's prayers become more powerful, they gain new names. Priestesses become Starlings, and their bright coloured robes are more elegant and detailed. Priests become Sparrowhawks, and their black robes gain streaks of brown and gold.
    5. **Sentinel.** Those clerics who have proven their wisdom and character, are able to take another trial at one of the Sky Temples. During this challenge they venture into a inner sanctum, whereby they are tested by the goddess's divine agents. If they prove their ability and virtue, they are marked by the divine, and become Sentinels.  The goddess gifts them with a blessing unique to the individual.  These Sentinels are the spiritual leaders of the order.
