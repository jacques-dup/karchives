* **Type:** Common Ethos: Polytheistic
* **Patron Deity:** [Heron](/religion/deities/heron)

## Worshippers:
General worship of of the Unyielding spans across both martial and philosophical occupations, but naturally weigh towards those with the ability to mete out poetic justice.  Therefor most of worshippers tend to be Paladins an battle hardened Clerics.

Followers of the church does not aim to balance the scales of good and evil, rather to extinguish all evil from the world through enforcing the laws and tenants of Heron.

## Priesthood:
Once initiated into the clerical ranks of the Church, they are assigned to a Society.  Some Societies can become quite large, enough to form an army, and as such are further divided into bands who govern themselves, called _Scabbards_. For the first five years, initiates are expected to live and train with the members of their society (or Scabbard) in order to form bonds of comradery and so that they can learn to fight as a unit.  Often priests are paired up where their combat styles compliment each other.  These pairs are called _Braces_.

The church expects all its priests to follow the Tenants of Heron, regardless of their occupation.  These laws apply not only to members of the church, but to the wider world and all those who stand in contrast to these laws are condemned.  However, those who are not evil but still refute the laws of Heron need to be protected regardless, as the virtue of Valor dictates such.  The priesthood sees any governing authority as absolute, unless it's policies contradict the tenants of Heron.

Paladins initiated in the church will follow the tenants of their society as well.  Depending on the society's overall goals and assigned purpose, these oaths are made in addition to Heron's law.  Paladin societies most commonly reflect the oaths of Conquest, Heroism or Vengeance.

5. **Triumvirate.** The Church of the Unyielding has three figure heads, known as the Triumvirate.  They account for the direction and interpretation of the wishes of the goddess, and determine all global actions and  initiatives like crusades or inquisitions against evil.  Only one of the Triumvirate can assign another, and only when one of them retires from duty, or is killed.
