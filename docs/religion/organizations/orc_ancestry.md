# The Path of The Blood
## An Orcish Ancestry {: .subtitle }

!!! info "Details"
    **Type:** Verdant and Seclusion Ethos

    **Patron:** [Garkash](../deities/garkash)

## Worshippers:
There are few Orcs who renounce their Blood Taint, as told in the myth of the [Black Seeding](../../../history/myths/black_seeding). They see Garkash as their progenitor and his existence gives them purpose. Especially in a world where all the Tainted are shunned and faced with prejudice.

To some degree, belief in other gods are entertained, though to revere them or take them as patron is regarded blasphemous, and usually punished by torture and eventual death.

## Priesthood:
The Orcish shaman acknowledge the organization and ranks of the [Church of Blood and Bone](../church_of_blood_and_bone), but have their own considerations when it comes to other races that are not ot the Tainted Blood. They are always considered outsiders in Orcish war bands, unless they attain the rank of Black Champion. 

Shaman remain loosely affiliated with the church, but use their own divinations as guide to determine if the church's aims and plans are worthy of their attention.

One is called to serve the war-god through the Mark of Garkash (not to be confused with the Church's title of rank). The Mark is a special characteristic, birth mark, or quirk of the individual's taint (usually some deformity), that marks them as chosen to serve the King of Battle.

### Hierarchy

??? abstract "Clerical Ranks"
    1. **Shaman Apprentice.** The Marked are apprenticed to a Shaman of Garkash, to serve and learn the ways of his command.
    2. **Shaman-priest.** Those who are proved by a Trial of Reckoning, become Shaman-priests. The trial is highly secretive and may change from tribe to tribe, but it usually takes the form of some mental and physical challenge to be completed. From the Church of Blood and Bone, the _Hound of the Master_ is of equal rank.
    3. **First Voice of Garkash.** In Orc war bands, there is one priest serving the War Chief. He is named the First Voice and his is regarded as that of Garkash himself. From the Church of Blood and Bone, the _Blood-kin_ are close to equal, but the First Voice has more influence over the War Chief if he is of the same tribe.
    4. **Black Champion.** There are those who embody the will of Garkash so, that they are beyond all warriors and even has authority over a War Chief. These are named by their god and blessed with his visage - black veins covering the skin as the Taint courses through their bodies.
