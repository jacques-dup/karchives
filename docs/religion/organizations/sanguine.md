# The Sanguine
## The Worshipping of Lilith {: .subtitle }

* **Type:** Common Ethos: Polytheistic
* **Patron Deity:** [Lilith](/religion/deities/lilith)

## Worshippers
The Sanguine follows a simple philosophy of primal urges. Their organization is less order more association, as their members tend to have an healthy disregard for established rules.

The Lady of Pleasures is revered through acts of pleasure giving and receiving. Anything goes where the goddess is present, and worshippers lose themselves in ecstasy at gatherings, partaking in pleasures of the mind and body. Alchemically induced trances and massive orgies are commonplace at the altars of Lilith, and those who partake stand free of judgement as their actions are deemed blessed and necessary by her holiness.

## Priesthood
Clergy of the Sanguine are always female and beautiful beyond comparison, as they are deemed as as the chosen vision of the goddess. Though men are accepted in the faith, only women can become true priests of Lilith. But men are required in many acts of indulgence, and as such they may enjoy the privilege of becoming a willing acolyte.

The Pleasure Houses of Lilith also serves as a refuge, to women in particular, who have suffered at the hand of oppression. The clergy is one of pacifism, but are more than capable of protecting all who seek their aid.

### Beliefs and Dogma

### Clerical Ranks
1. **Cloaked Rose.** Men who joins the servitude of a House (Temple), are named as a CLoaked Rose. During their stay at the House they are only allowed to wear a red cloak adorned with flowers, giving them their name. They serve at the whims of all who come to the House and must obey every instruction any guest or priestess gives them without fail.
2. **Nubilite.** Young women who become priests of Lilith are called Nubilites. They are taken in by a House and trained in the ways of pleasure, command and philosophy. When inside the House, they are required to be completely naked, but they may choose not to partake in some acts of pleasure if they are unwilling. They are pardoned their modesties as true freedom of self only comes with wisdom and experience.
3. **Enchantress.** Those priestesses who shows talent in all the ways expected may be accepted as an Enchantress. They are required to teach at a house, manage events and host important guests. They are allowed to wear clothing within the House, but usually this is not used as a way to cover up their modesty. Rather they use the opportunity to wear elaborate costumes and jewelry to enhance their naked appeal.
4. **Red Siren.** The matron of a House is known as a Red Siren. She presides over a region and protects her own flock of followers to her own abilities and wisdom. They entertain only the most important guests and manage administrative and political affairs.
