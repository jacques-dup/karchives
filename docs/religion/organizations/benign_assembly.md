!!! info "Details"
    **Type:** Common Ethos: Polytheistic

    **Patron:** [Elmara](/religion/deities/elmara)

## Worshippers:
Elmara's devout are graceful, diplomatic and radiates virtue. They are as the face of the goddess. Her followers are some of the best accomplished diplomats of the ages, as the blessings of the Lady propagates wisdom patience.

## Priesthood:
The clergy of Elmara are accomplished diplomats in their own right. To be accepted into the church requires a small manner of etiquette and instruction, which makes it unlikely for the lower classes to join the ranks. However, children of any upbringing may find their way to the Assembly through the _Law of Nomination_.

The _Law of Nomination_ decrees that any one person brought to the Halls of the Assembly should be given an audience with at least three _Delegates_. If at least one of them agrees that the nominee should be accepted for instruction, the Assembly must accept them. In practice this is commonly used to recruit children into the ranks of to be clerics, but it is not unheard of for adults to be accepted this way.

The Assembly Temples are schools in a sense, where prospective clergy are instructed in the ways of the Courts. Once they reach an adult age, and have passed their instructors' trials, they are eligible to be assigned as a diplomat. If this position is held for a minimum of one year, the cleric is regarded as a full-fledged and fully trained member of the Assembly.

### Hierarchy

??? abstract "Clerical Ranks"
    1. **Nominee.** Those in training to the clergy are named Nominees. They need not ultimately join the Clergy and the title is seen as a boon to any noble who happened to be schooled by the Masters of the Assembly. All nominees receive a item of jewelry or adornment to their vestments, called a _Regalia_, which may be mundane or enchanted, signifying their enlistment into the Assembly.
    2.  **Ensign.** Once a Nominee's training has progressed that they may be marked for full membership, they may choose to pass a Trial of Temperance, where they are tested for their virtue and ability to live by the codes of the Assembly. Once passed, they are named Ensign. Their _Regalia_ gains a rune, signifying that they passed the Trial. 
    3.  **Envoy of the Assembly.** Once training is completed, and the cleric are sent on their first diplomatic mission, they are named Envoy of the Assembly. Their Regalia gains a haloed crest of gold.
    4.  **Steward.** Those who continue their study at the Assembly may become Stewards. As part of their own studies they are required to teach those of lower rank. A Steward is marked by a pin, to be worn on their clothes at all times, styled to resemble a mask, adorned with an emerald.
    5.  **Delegate.** The Leaders of the Assembly, as nominated and assigned by their superiors, are called Delegates. There are at least three, but more commonly up to ten Delegates at a temple. They administrate the Assembly Court and set the trials for those rising through the ranks. All decisions are made through diplomatic voting and discussion. Their _Regalia_ gains the rune of Wisdom, signifying their rank and trials passed.
    6.  **Crown of the Assembly.** Each temple as three Crowns, to serve as the de facto authority whenever the Delegates require council. Each Crown has a virtue and duty to uphold. One representing Order, signified by a crown of Bronze. One represents Protection, signified by a crown of Steel. And one representing Unity, signified by a crown of Silver. If one should resign or pass, the next is chosen by the Crowns from a list of nominees supplied by the Delegates.
