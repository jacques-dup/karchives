# The House of Dawn
## Church of Lord Aster {: .subtitle }

!!! info "Details"
    **Type:** Common Ethos: Polytheistic 

    **Patron:** [Lord Aster](/religion/deities/lord_aster)

## Worshippers:
The followers of Lord Aster seek out the guiding light in all situations, and take refuge in the sun as a symbol of the Morning Lord's strength. Even more so, they themselves become beacons of light in the dark world, proclaiming the word of the eternal sun.

The devout seek out the morning sun for times of worship, and song frequents the fields of flowers in the early glow. They congregate, share and build together a morality of life, hope and the never-ending fight against the darkness in the world.  But hold fast to the knowledge that light always conquers, and always brings truth to that which is unseen.

## Priesthood:
Choral music plays a big role in the priesthood of Lord Aster and all initiates are taught to sing.  It is most common that boys will be nominated to become part of the church by their families because of their vocal talents.

As followers are initiated they become Chanters of the House, and are required to spend a full year within the halls of their House to receive instruction by their superiors. The House divides their chanters into groups they call choirs, who work, learn and live together for that year. Studies focus on the esoteric healing and artistic practices of the order during this time.

After their first year, their training program shifts to martial instruction and the banishment of undead. During this time they rotate choirs often. It lasts for between three and five years, depending on how quickly the devout learns his/her skills.

After their training the devout may take up their cloak as a Cleric or Paladin of the order, from where they are encouraged to venture out into the world to seek out the dark places and bring the light of Lord Aster to to its threshold.

### Beliefs And Dogma

### Hierarchy

??? abstract "Clerical Ranks"
    1. **Son of the Flowers.** Boys who are sent to the church are not full members of the order and are known as Sons of the Flowers.  They serve as apprentices, pages or chamber servants to the priests, until they can become full members. During this time they are taught the philosophies and beliefs of the church and sing in the choirs of the House.
    2. **Chanter.** Those initiated to the House become Chanters, so called for their morning chants and ritual songs.
    3. **Dawn Priest.** Once their training is finished, the devout may choose to don the cloak of the Dawn Priest. They become full, independent members of the church able to venture out into the world to bring the light of the Morninglord to it. The can even found new House Chapels where needed.
    4. **Sun-kissed Dawn Priest.** The devout who are able to achieve a great feat of faith and blessing, such as slay a very powerful undead being, are marked by the Full Sun Disc - their holy symbol mirrored to both sides to form one whole. They are the holy champions of the faith and deserve the respect of all within the House. One does not need to be a Sun-kissed to advance in rank, it is an additional title bestowed upon the Dawn Priest.
    5. **White Cloak.** The Dawn Priests who take up the responsibility to administer the the House, may be granted the title and adornment of a White Cloak. Their authority is the law of the Morninglord.
    6. **Prime of the Morning.** The highest authority of the organization is the Prime. Each serves in their own region and their authorities never overlap.
