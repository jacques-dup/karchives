## Worshippers
Worshippers of the Primordial Serpent believe that the Dragon-kind is the ultimate form of life in the cosmos and should be revered above all else, even above the divine themselves.

The believe that the gods were once mortal like all other beings and inferior to that of the primordial dragons, as Throden himself is from that era and stands as example of the might that all Dragons can strive to become.

All those with Dragon blood and heritage are superior to all other life on earth. Kobolds in particular hold much reverence as they not only evolved from the Great Wyrms of old, but their society actively pursue the preservation of Draconic lore and heritage.

All those inferior to Dragons still have a place among the faithful, as they exist to serve Dragon-kind and will be rewarded for their service through the benevolence of the Great Wyrms of old.

## Priesthood
Individuals are initiated into grouped sects withing the order. Once accepted by the priests. They lose their freedom and dedicate their lives to the worship and servitude of a Dragon Prince, one who stands as patron to the sect.  Each sect is therefore different as the whims of each Dragon is his own.

As initiates prove their worth they are blessed by their Patron with gifts, status, power, or if they are lucky, the acknowledgement of their Patron.
