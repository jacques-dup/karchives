# The Following of Divine Arcana
## The Church of Maia, Goddess of Magic {: .subtitle }

* **Type:** Polytheistic
* **Patron Deity:** Maia, Goddess of Magic, Grimoirs, Arcana and Spells

## Common Worship and General Knowledge:
Maia, as a one of the major deities of Aklatoria, has followers in all major centers and across cultures and embracing the polytheistic ethos of this realm.  Anyone can choose Maia as their patron and even those not claimed to her faith are known to pray at her shrines on occasion, especially when a problem of magical nature is faced by the devout.

Even among the uninitiated, it is known that Maia was once a mere mortal, of an ancient, long-extinct race that lived before mortals were able to tame the Myst and wield magic as a tool.  As a seeker of knowledge, she gained divinity by binding herself to the Myst realm and being a conduit for mortals to channel its power to the material realm.

## Beliefs and Dogma of the Clergy: 
Clergy of Maia are seekers of truth and knowledge, specifically that of an arcane nature.  As part of the initiation, followers are to complete a grueling trial of the mind called the Rite of Myst.  The trial reveals which branch of the clergy the follower is initiated to.

**There are three branches of the church:**

* **The Scribes of Neverium** are those who search for magical scripts and keep a record of the arcane histories.  Their name is derived from the first organized order of Maia.

* **The Staffs of Aegis** are those who use magic to enforce the will of the cosmos.  Their name is derived from the silver moon of Aegis, the realm of order.

* **The Eyes of the Ever-realms** are those who revel in the mysteries of the Myst and its ever-changing nature.  The name is derived from the Church’s title for the realm of Myst.

To the clergy, their goddess is not a mere entity or patron overseeing the magic of the world.  To them, she is the embodiment of magic and the primary conduit of all magic.  By becoming The Conduit, she gained absolute power and the clergy believes she is probably the most powerful of all known deities.

Maia is strongly tied to the World Trees.  These sites are the anchors that tie the Ever-realms to the world and the primary channel of magical energy into the material plain.  The clergy believes that at each of these sites, a physical embodiment of Maia can be found, where she is chained to its magic by unbreakable chains of parchment.

## Clerical Ranks
1. **Uninitiated.** The church believes all who acknowledge Maia has a place in her church, but not all are chosen to have her secrets revealed.
2. **Wand-lings.** Once initiated, a cleric gains the rank of a “Wandling”.  So named for their first duties include crafting wand shafts for the order’s listed enchanters.
3. **Spell-marked.** Once an initiate’s worth is proven, she gains a magical mark on her skin.  Its form cannot be chosen and is made by undergoing a secret ritual. Clerics wear these with pride.  Although denied by the church, it is said that the more elaborate the mark, the more favor the cleric will enjoy from the goddess.
4. **Star-bound.** The first rank of leadership is in the form of a silver star, worn in some form on the cleric’s clothing.  Star-bound have authority over others of lower rank and may contest decisions made by the leaders of a shrine.  They, however, have no final claim on the outcomes of individual decisions but are always heard.  Star-bound may be shrine leaders themselves should they choose to settle.
5. **Robed.** The Robed are known by the clerical robes they wear, akin to the depictions of the goddess herself.  They serve as inquisitors to the church and have the authority to overrule individual shrine decisions but doing so only in extreme circumstances. Almost all shrines have one Robed as an advisor.
6. **Myst-touched.** Clerics who achieve great deeds of renown and glory for the church are often promoted to Myst-touched.  They are marked with a ring of power and they may choose to take on the mantle of the Robed or Star-bound (along with its duties) but with an elevated status and authority.
7. **Chosen three.** The chosen three are each the heads of one of the branches of the church.  They are well known, and each owns a staff of power – relics of the order.
8. **Moonchildren.**  A handful of followers are granted the rank of Moonchildren.  They are chosen by the goddess herself and do not need to be part of the church’s clerical order.  They have absolute authority over the other ranks and are known to manifest the greatest of magical abilities as a gift from the goddess.  They are known by their ability to compel the true devout of Maia regardless of rank and for that their physical appearance starting to attain aspects of the Myst itself, like eyes shining of daylight or skin of molten diamond.
9. **Mother of the Moons and Star.** One devout is chosen by the clerics.  She becomes known as the Mother and through a secret rite known only to the Moonchildren, she gains immunity to their compulsion and the ability to command them instead.  Her main purpose is to keep the church united and to be the protector of its secrets and tenants.  No one but the Mother knows what the rank entails, but all are compelled to do her bidding.
