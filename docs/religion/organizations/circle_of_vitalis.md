## Worshippers:
The Circle of Vitalis knows life as it knows death, and hints to the mortal realms at what lies beyond both.  Primarily associated with healing, the clergy of the circle are well respected across the realms as bringers of hope and instauration.

But it is well known the price of life needs to be balanced and that sometimes the church brings tidings of death and loss as well.

## Priesthood:
Clerics of Vitalis rarely chooses a single patron, although it is not unheard of, especially amongst the followers of Armara, Lenkinfail and Ornim.  The clergy of the Circle follow most of the moral principles of all its patrons equally though, which often contradicts the will of the one god or goddess.

None of the clergy start out as an initiate of Vitalis and all come from other sects and churches who then decide to serve the balance of life. When initiated into the Circle, followers choose anew they alignment to the divine essences in order to serve the balance to the best of their abilities.  Good or Evil moralities are grayed into one binding principle - that All life is balanced.  They see both opposing forces of life and death as sacred to this balance.

As such, the Circle controls the use of resurrection spells across the realms.  Rarely do they offer it as a blessing and never as a service.

Once accepted into the order, the cleric's vestments or sigil is decorated with an image of a snake swallowing it's own tail - green for those who channel positive energies and black for those who channel negative energies.  Some legends say that the patrons themselves decide how the initiate is best to serve the Circle, and in some cases the imbued power is in opposition to what the cleric was aligned with before.

### Hierarchy

??? abstract "Clerical Ranks"
    1. **Novitiate.** Are newcomers to the order who have just received the mark of the snake sigil.  The are the eyes and ears of the Circle and are required to travel the realms to heal. They advance to the next rank as soon as the patrons them with the Revivify prayer.
    2. **Arbitrator.** As the patrons start to trust in the judgement of the cleric and grants him the Revivify prayer, they become known as Arbitrators.  They are marked with a golden band or lining in their clerical regalia and are considered defacto authority in the church wherever there are no higher ranking clergy.
    3. **Consul.** As the patrons grant the cleric with the Raise Dead prayer, they become known as Consul Vitalitae and are marked with another sign of any one of the patrons, depending on their alignment and purpose.  Their authority can veto any lower ranking clerics, who must obey the word of the Circle patrons through the selected consul.
    4. **Factotum.** The highest ranking clerics of the Circle are called Factotum.  Once able to cast the Resurrection prayer, the cleric must undergo a ritual of passing.  If such a cleric dies in any unnatural way, she can be resurrected by another Factotum and achieve the same rank. She is marked by death, proclaiming this rank, and reflecting the means by which the cleric had died. When a factotum speaks, they are specking the will of the Circle Patrons themselves, which cannot be disobeyed by any in the order - even if it is to start a war.
