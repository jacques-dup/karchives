!!! info "Details"
    **Type:** Verdant Ethos: Animism

    **Patron:** [Duswyn](../deities/duswyn)

## Worshippers:
The followers of Duswyn are amongst other things quite eccentric. For one their chief philosophy in life is to experience the thrill of inebriation as often as possible, yet their motivation is very much rooted in holy scriptures, said to have been written by the Drunk god himself, and compelling argument.

They are philosophers of note, and scholars to some measure, though their choice of discourse and research tend to be quite one tracked and some would say unimaginative - all involving the study of brewing, cultivating the ingredients for brewing, the different methods of consuming said brews, and on occasion, the sociological analyses of the people enjoying such consumption. The amount of literature composed about these topics are to the uninitiated quite astounding.

## Priesthood:
The Friars (and Sisters) of the Tankard are, for the most part, seen as useless, alcoholic, menaces. At least in the civilized societies of the realms.  And though it is im some cases aptly attributed, they are appreciated in times of revelry. The Drunk god blesses those who follow his scriptures in many ways, including the gifts to extend the supplies of whine, loosen the uptight and liven the halls of any court with song and celebration.

The Friars hold no land and build no chapels. The realms are their congregation and the taverns their place of worship. Though many wealthy nobles and royalty would kill for a renowned Friar to become their appointed brewer, it is often more trouble than it is worth. Even though many of the clergy are exceptional at the craft, they tend not be sober enough to really apply it, and they tend to sample the harvest too often.  So much so that their employer could just as well expect no yield.

### Beliefs And Dogma
The Friars believe that the state of drunkenness is the closest any mortal can experience to being part of the divine. They see it as a gateway to enlightenment and that the subtleties of the brew are like the notes of a heavenly choir, hinting at the intricacies of what immortal perception feels like.

### Hierarchy
The Friars does not believe any one above or below any other, as all mortals stand on the same plane under the heavens. Though they do pay tribute to those who show a particular talent for their unique lifestyle. Those who can brew or cook enjoy the benefits of being appreciated by outsiders as well.
