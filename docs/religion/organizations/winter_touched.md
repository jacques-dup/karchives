# The Winter-Touched
## A Sect of Vonryl Kethalon, the goddess of Eternal Winter {: .subtitle }

!!! info "Details"
    **Type:** Common Ethos: Polytheistic
    
    **Patron Deity:** [Vonryl Kethalon](../deities/vonryl_kethalon), goddess of Eternal Winter

## Worshippers:
All Elves, even those who are goodly aligned, regard Vonryl Kethalon as influential and spiritually significant to their history and daily lives.  Vonryl Kethalon herself has chosen the Elves as her champions and rarely decide to openly harm any of them.  As such, many relationships that Elves have with with the _Sect of the Winter Touched_ can be one of mutual benefit.

For the most part the Sect is tolerated, since they do not openly ascribe doing evil to its initiated, though they most definitely do not serve the greater good of all, but rather the ambitions of the Elvin race as exclusively.

## Priesthood: 
The clergy of the Sect believes that that which is due will not come naturally and must most often be taken by force.  There is no balance in the cosmos, only chaos, and that chaos should serve only to provide order and enforce the laws set out by the goddess.

Her will, however is mysterious and clerics are encouraged to be guided by her signs, most commonly seen in the coldest places on earth.  As such, most of her monasteries are hidden away in the tundras of the realms and on the highest mountains they might have.  Clergy (often monks) will spend their time in cold seclusion in order to glimpse something of the truth of her enlightenment.

Martial skill is well regarded in the Sect, and in order to ascend in rank one must be able to wield your body as a weapon.  Monastic traditions include a rigorous training regime and regular trials by combat.  Once an initiate can prove their martial prowess to one of a higher rank, they may ascend to the next level and as such come closer to being truly enlightened.

### Hierarchy

??? abstract "Clerical Ranks"
    1. **Fist of Winter.** In order to join the Sect, the initiate needs to spend ten years studying at one of the monasteries.  Once completed, they are regarded as _Fists of Winter_.  From there they are free to go and do as they please.  Many _Fists_ will take positions of influence within the Elvin society and are generally well regarded and known for their ruthless and unbiased council - as taught through the tenants of the Sect.
    2. **Devil Slayer.** At some point in the life of an initiate, they may choose to undergo the a martial trial. Initiates pair up in duos, and an Ice Devil is summoned from [Tundrum Arctis](../../../cosmology/planes/tundrum_arctis).  Together they must defeat the devil in order for both to be granted the title of _Devil SLayer_.  These clergy are marked on their bodies with a ceremonial tattoo to indicate their achievement.
    3. **Enlightened** Clerics who remain in the monasteries long enough, or through frequent visits of study, are able to take a final trial to test not only their martial prowess, but also their mental stamina. This time without aid, an individual cleric is cast into the plane of elemental frost, without any supplies.  Once their they begin their journey to find meet their goddess in person.  Whether they see her manifest or not, it they survive a week within the plane without physical or mental trauma, they are considered to be touched by the goddess and as such an Enlightened.
