## Worshippers:
The Circle of Arcana is a Pantheon grouping of all deities associated with magic in some way.  Its followers are typically scholars of the Arcane or at least practitioners of magic.

It is said that Maia, goddess of Magic elected to call the Circle together in order to better control the use and rules governing the cosmos, including specifically the realm of Myst, Places of Power, Artifacts of magic and the Creatures spawned by it.

The Circle gathers in the Crystal Palace, on the plane of Myst in order to decide on the outcomes of many magical related situations.  They guide their followers through visions and gifts of magic in order to achieve a balance in the cosmos.

## Priesthood: 
Clerics of the Arcane Circle follow the tenants of Balance over anything.  They might consider a single patron theirs, or worship all as a pantheon, but that which exceeds even the whims and wills of the gods is the super-divine rule that all power needs to be balanced in order for the universe to survive.  Every action has an appropriate and opposite reaction.

Being able to restore the balance of magic in some place or form is an ultimate act of faith in the order.  Such accomplishments are considered Deeds of Correction, and is celebrated amongst the followers of the faith.  On rare occasions, such a Deed will be in conflict to the wishes of the cleric's chosen patron.  Being able to make such a sacrifice is considered a very high honour in the Circle of the Arcane as it shows conviction to the Balance despite the will of the individual.

### Hierarchy

??? abstract "Clerical Ranks"
    1. **Arcus** Initiated are known as Arcus, the followers of the tenants of Balance.
    2. **Mystborn** Once a cleric has was able to complete a Deed of Correction, they are recognized as a Mystborn Arcus.
    3. **Arch-mage** Once a cleric perfects a specialized study of magic, whether it be a wizardry school, artifice or even clerical prayer-casting, they may be considered an Arch-mage of the order. Arch-mages are the keepers of the magical artifacts and places, so ascending to this rank brings additional duties of inspecting places of power and seeking out rumours of artifacts that need protection.
    4. **Chosen of Three** Clerics of the Circle of Arcana may also be blessed by Maia to become one of the Chosen Three as per the [Church of Maia](/religion/organizations/church_of_maia#chosen_3).
