## Common Worship and General Knowledge:
Followers and clerics of the Elemental Courts are for the most part, spell practitioners aligned to elemental magic. These include a number of druids and evokers.

Stoic to the comings and goings of the times, they are often most seen in rural or verdant places within the realms, where people tend to regard the natural powers of the elements with more consideration.

## Beliefs and Dogma of the Clergy: 
Most of the initiates of the Elemental Courts tend to be druids, and their dogma aligns with that of the natural powers.  The elements and the elemental planes are regarded as an A Priori allegory of creation. Its true form is is something beyond its manifestation and can be called upon if the one who studies it can see it for what it truly is.

The church studies philosophy and dialogue about the nature of being often.  Shrouded in figurative oratory and dualistic analyses, they often seem aloof and caught up in their own imaginations.

Practically speaking, its priests follow all its patrons equally, as there is power in the understanding of the wholistic picture.
