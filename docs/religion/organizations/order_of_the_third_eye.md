!!! info "Details"
    **Type:** Seclusion Ethos: Pseudo-Polytheistic

    **Patron:** [Firna](/religion/deities/firna)

## Worshippers:
The devout of the Assassin, goddess of Shadow, believe in the sacrificial blood of those who oppose her might and instruction.

They deal in chaos and fear, dominating the less powerful to submit to the divine words of blood. Murder comes naturally to these mortals, as a willing act of praise to the one who wields the true Source Power of the cosmos. By accepting the enlightenment of the Third Eye will become truly free when even their own souls leave their planar bodies.

## Priesthood:
Those who don the mark of the Third Eye are the entitles inheritors of chaos and the divine blessed oppressors of the realms. Stepping int the guise of the Unholy Dominator, one gains the superior knowledge of what life truly means and as such become its gatekeeper.

Clerics of the Order does not apply for acceptance. Rather, the order chooses their potential recruits in secret and then reaches out with a challenge. This challenge is a rite of blood sacrifice and to refuse it is to choose death.

The order itself is shrouded in secrecy. Members gather in dark places to discuss the will of the goddess, usually ending in the planning of a murder. In some places they can even be hired by outsiders to perform such deeds, though it is always on the terms of the cleric.

The order protects its members fiercely, disposing of evidence and witnesses. In unity they are strongest, but the reckless are punished, usually with death.

### Beliefs And Dogma
To create life is simple and unthinking, but to take life is a calculated, passionate call to something greater than the cosmos. Through death's escape does one see the truth about the divines. As a soul plunges into the void, their final moments are of true freedom.

### Hierarchy

??? abstract "Clerical Ranks"
    1. **Bloodling.** Once the rite of passage is passed by a recruit, they are given the title of Bloodling. Their duty is to obey. Instruction comes from the higher ranks. They may not question, only act.
    2. **Daggerborne.** As the Bloodling serves, they may be chosen for their first assassination and if they complete the task they become a Daggerborne. These clerics receive a magical dagger marked with the sigil and blessing of Firna.
    3. **Shadowling.** Reliable agents gain more authority and become the information or equipment dealers of the order. A Shadowling may even become a public face of the order - a contact whereby outsiders can request services from.
    4. **Grave Keeper.** Keepers are those who are smart and skilled enough to become powerful influencers and tacticians withing the Order. They are the ones who devise the orders of the lower recruits and are the administrators of the secret temples of Firna.
    5. **Grand Assassin.** The most talented killers may become independent agents, able to operate outside of the order's instruction. These are Grand Assassins and they owe no servitude to any but Firna herself.
    6. **Eye of Firna.** Sect leaders are known as the Eyes of Firna. Their identities are usually hidden and they speak through their Grand Assassins. They alone have seen into the void beyond life and knows the will of Firna.
