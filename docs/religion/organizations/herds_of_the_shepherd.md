# The Herds of the Shepherd
## The Collective Church of Erthan {: .subtitle }

!!! info "Details"
    **Type:** Verdant Ethos: Polytheistic Animism

    **Patron:** [Erthan](../deities/erthan)

## Worshippers:
The devout of Erthan consider themselves in the care of the divines, in particular Erthan the Father of the Fields. They are not merely his worshippers, they are his children, his charges.

Being considered one of the Herd is to accept that mortals are purposefully created as "lesser" beings. This does not mean that they are unimportant or that their life isn't sacred. It merely means that there is logic and spiritual peace in accepting the dive order of beings.

Being part of the herd also means that mortals are at the disposal of the divine, to be used for their greater purposes, and that Erthan is the only one who is truly committed to taking care of his flock.

## Priesthood:
The clergy of the Shepherd are shepherds themselves. It is their duty to be the keeper of the followers of Erthan on earth.  They are teachers, mentors, care-takers and leaders among the communities of the realms.

To become a Shepherd is to renounce power in favour of servitude. They care not for material riches, but rather serve the people and the land in balance with each other. They work with their flock and pray to The Master of the Seasons to bless their yield, offering divine intervention where required.

The Clergy are considered a collective and all who gain the blessing of Erthan are shepherds in their own light. All stand as equals in the church and when they meet, they do so to serve a higher purpose mostly.

### Beliefs And Dogma
The Herd believes that everything has a balance and that everything is worth protecting. They see themselves of servants of the divines and take solace in the fact that their chosen deity is benevolent and protecting of their well being.

### Hierarchy
The clergy does not consider hierarchy and see all as equals under the power of the god. They do, however acknowledge the wisdom of identifiable leaders, as even a herd of Shepherds require a Shepherd of their own. As a cleric becomes more enlightened and therefore more blessed by Erthan, they attribute titles of honour, and defer leadership. But co consider if a strict hierarchy would be foolish.
