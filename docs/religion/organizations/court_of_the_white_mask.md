# The Court pf the White Mask
## Sect of Thieves and the Treacherous {: .subtitle }

!!! info "Details"
    **Type:** Common Ethos: Polytheistic

    **Patron:** [Callad](../deities/callad)

## Worshippers:
Worship among the faithful of Callad is highly secretive and obfuscated. Gatherings happen in the dark hours of the night, participants all wearing masks of smooth white to hide their faces. They congregate behind closed doors and in deep cellars and tunnels, away from all prying eyes.

For the nature for the Queen of Thieves is secretive, and to proclaim her is to call for her judgement.

But her worship brings allies in unlikely places, as long as there is mutual gain to be had.

## Priesthood:
Becoming part of the clergy of the Princess of Darkness is to embrace the treacherous nature of the underworld. Her blessings serve as protections in this harsh underbelly, and provides a pragmatic network to those in need of shadowy services.

These networks are established and maintained by what the Court calls _Gatherings_. These meetups are led by her clergy and bring together those of like-minded morality and "trade".

Her clerics may be part of any organization fighting for control in the secret world below the public. Their purpose is only to lead her gatherings and the cleric can use her gifts as they choose, in whatever self serving aims they might have. Such id the nature of the goddess.

### Hierarchy
The Court does not care much for hierarchy, and only acknowledge the achievements of the ones able to take it. Yet there are three designations in the sects, in order to attribute duties and roles at gatherings. 

??? abstract "Clerical Ranks"
    1. **Masked.** Those who partake in the _Gathering_ are named the Masked, as the white mask they are required to wear at the occasions.
    2. **Oath Bearers.** Those who have received the divine blessings of Callad, who have become part of her priesthood, are named the Oath Bearers. They manage and administrate the _Gathering_. The status brings some protection from their peers, and one might say a refuge from the law to some extent, though only the bold and able are preferred in the Courts.
    3. **Spectre.** The leader of a Court (usually only one per city), is called the Spectre. To become it, one must be assigned by the previous. "Assigned" is used loosely as a opportunistic rogue might be able to step into a vacant position given the right circumstances. Spectres are typically very well connected and powerful.
