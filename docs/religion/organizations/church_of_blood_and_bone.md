# The Church of Blood and Bone
## The way of Garkash {: .subtitle }

!!! info "Details"
    **Type:** Common Ethos: Polytheistic

    **Patron:** [Garkash](/religion/deities/garkash)

## Worshippers:
Garkash has one commandment: "kill". His followers excel at it by means of his blood rage, a divine berserkery that transcends the bounds of mortal motives.

Those who follow in his way are blessed with challenging battles and the strength to overthrow their enemies beyond all tactical reckoning. They are faceless and worthy only to serve as sacrifice to the One who Defines all Battles.

## Priesthood:
The clergy of Garkash are merciless and powerful. The ambitious is drawn to his call, stimulating the primal urges to kill and dominate. As such there are more shaman and druid-priests that revere him, as his animalistic urges resounds their own.

To become part of his clergy requires to be chosen by the war-god himself, as proclaimed by a divine act of victory. Prospective initiates are tested for acceptance into the church through a trial by combat - a battle to the death.

Other ways to enter the order is to be marked by Garkash. Wounds that would have killed lesser men may serve as such a mark, but only if verified by a current priest of Blood and Bone.

Priests serve a War Chief in the name of Garkash. To serve in a time of peace is to invite disgrace, though Garkash is often silent as he has little care for individual warriors. Only the worthy deserve the blessings of the war-god.

### Hierarchy

??? abstract "Clerical Ranks"
    1. **Chosen of the Hound.** Once an initiate has passed a trial by combat, facing off against other initiates, they are named a Chosen of the Hound, and are accepted as a priest of Garkash. But only if they continue to prove themselves do they progress in power and influence within the order. THose unable to prove their worth are cast out of the order.
    2. **Marked of Garkash.** Being a chosen means one is blessed with strength against death, and as such only the priests who fight on the front lines are worthy. The more scars of battle the priest has the more is he labeled as a "Marked" priest.
    3. **Hound of the Master.** Once sufficiently "Marked", a priest becomes a Hound of the Master. They are council to the captains of their war bands and as such no longer fight on the front lines. Their experience and knowledge of the ways of Garkash makes them valuable figureheads in the church. They are close enough to the field to hold the morale of the men, yet far enough to remain alive to serve.
    4. **Blood-kin Shaman.** Priests who serve the War Chief directly are called Blood-kin. There are usually only one or two of them in a war band.
    5. **Black Champion.** There are those who embody the will of Garkash so, that they are beyond all warriors and even has authority over a War Chief. These are named by their god and blessed with his visage - black veins covering the skin as the Taint courses through their bodies.
