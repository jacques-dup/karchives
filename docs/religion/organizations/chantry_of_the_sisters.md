## Worshippers:
Followers of Chaos believe that the cosmos is in a constant state of entropy, and that the true inheritors of it is the daughters who spawned from its Source.

_Nox_, the eternal blood moon of Aklatoria is the mother of all Chaos, and therefore her daughters are the chosen progenitors of all life. For without Chaos, the cosmos is stuck in immovable stasis.

Therefore, the Chantry of the Sisters follow Chaos in all its forms, but proclaim the Daughters as their salvation.

## Priesthood:
To become one with Chaos requires sacrifice, and it is achieved in ritual though the Dark Baptism by the Seed of Chaos. Predominantly a clergy of priestesses, the baptism takes the form of a horrific ritual whereby a demon is summoned from _Nox_, and the acolyte is offered for union. If a Tiefling is born of the encounter it is seen as a divine blessing of the Sisters.

Men are not as easily proven, and they are required to venture into the plane of _Nox_ itself to stand before one of the demon lords who rule it's holds. They are required to complete one task for the demon, and if successful, they are proven to the Chantry.

The clergy of the Chantry become baptised by the seed of Chaos, after which they join a House of one of the Sisters. They receive the blessings as per the patron of their House. Each house in each Chantry temple has unique rituals and requirements from their clerics, but once accepted into one, the cleric is forever part of the major church.

### Beliefs And Dogma
The Chantry believes each of the Sisters have merits that serve the greater Chaos of the cosmos, but know that all of _Nox_ is to rule over the realms once the scales are tipped to the balance of the Blood Moon. They sometimes shun clerics of the individual deities as unenlightened, and accept those who want to convert from the independent organizations into the Chantry, as long as they fulfil the requirements of the Dark Baptism.

### Hierarchy

??? abstract "Clerical Ranks"
    1. **Acolyte.** Those who have not yet passed through the rite of the Dark Baptism, are known as Acolytes.
    2. **Demonborne.** Once the Dark Baptism is passed, the cleric is known as a Demonborne priest/priestess and are attributed a House to serve.
    3. **Blood Marked.** The captains of a Chantry House are named the Blood Marked, named as such by the rite of _Blending_, where they consume the blood of a demon. Not all survive.
    4. **Matron.** Priestesses assigned to rule a Chantry House is called a Matron. They are high priestesses of their patron in their own right - even among their clerics outside of the Chantry. They may therefore hold additional ranks in any of the Daughters' churches.
    5. **Grand Daughters of the Three.** The Chantry temple leaders form a council called the Grand Daughters of the Three. They rule the Chantry and their Houses by the blessings of Chaos.
