# The Ordos Valorium
## The Knights of Valor {: .subtitle }

!!! info "Details"
    **Type:** Common Ethos: Polytheistic

    **Patron Deity:** [Elmara](../deities/elmara), [Heron](../deities/heron), [Lex Fireheart](../deities/lex_fireheart), [Lord Aster](../deities/lord_aster), [Martivir](../deities/martivir)

    **Identification:** The symbol of the order is a six pointed, golden star worn on the clothing or armour of the member knights.

## Worshippers:
When working together towards a common goal, those who live by the virtues of honour, justice and valor are able to achieve greatness in a dark and chaotic world.  They bring order to the entropy of the cosmos and are beacons of shining light in the abyss.

Such is the code of the Ordos Valorium, a knighthood, a brother-and-sisterhood, of like-minded individuals who share a common morality through the patrons they choose to associate with.

Members of the Order doesn't single out a deity to serve, but rather choose to serve in the commonalities and joined philosophies of all in the pantheon.  They associate a key virtue to each, as for their involvement in the lives of those who join the order and are named by their sigil.

??? abstract "The Five Constellations of Virtue"
    **The Constellation of the Lady** is depicted by Elmara, and stands for _Prudence_. It encourages the Knight to be thoughtful, practical and wise in their dealings.
    
    **The Constellation of the Mare** is depicted by Heron, and stands for _Loyalty_. It reminds the Knight that they are never alone, but also that they owe one another the benefit of their aid.

    **The Constellation of the Sword** is from Lex Fireheart, and stands for _Bravery_, for all Knights are unflinching in the face of evil.

    **The Constellation of the Dragon** is a depiction of Martivir, and stands for _Justice_. None can escape it, and the Knight is chartered with delivering it where others are unable to do so.

    **The Sigil of the Star** is derived from Lord Aster, and stands for _Purity_, as Knights are required to be clear of conscience when they fight against the evils of this world, so that they can be the guiding light to those around them.

## Knighthood:
Those who choose to enlist in the Ordos Valorium are trained to fight as Paladins of the faith, and receive the blessings of the pantheon.  For the first few years they are trained in defence through combat as well as healing, both magical and not.  But as they progress in their training, they can choose to become full Knights of the Ordos Valorium by undergoing an Oath ceremony.

??? abstract "Common Paladin Oaths of the Order"
    The Order dictates that the virtues of the Five be followed though all times, but the Knight may choose their own Oath as revealed to them through their own prayers and meditations. Mos commonly, the Knights choose to undertake the **Oath of Devotion**, as its powers and tenants resonate best with that of the Order.  But there are a division within the ranks that also take the **Oath of Heroism**.  These knights typically form the vanguards of the crusade.

    Then there are also a division of knights who choose to take the **Oath of the Watchers**. Though they are few, their purpose is noble, as they choose to be the guards against the darkness of the Outer Realms, the place from which the darkness originates.

    Other Oaths have been taken, though they are in the minority. Given the right circumstances there might be a need for many different types of knights, and the Order recognizes this possibility. These cases are rare, however, and for the most part these paladins stand on the fringes of the Order, not really progressing through its ranks.

### Beliefs and Dogma: 

#### Tenants of the Valorous

??? abstract "Knight's Code"
    * _Prudence_ and _Wisdom_ is a primary virtue of a well mannered Knight.
    * _Loyalty_ is the cornerstone of the brother-and-sisterhood and should be sought above all else.
    * _Bravery_ is paramount and fear is to be cast aside.
    * _Purity_ of heart takes presidents over law.
    * _Justice_ and _Retribution_ stand hand in hand, but should never turn to vengeance.

### Hierarchy
The Order maintains a very strict military hierarchy as a means of discipline and show of respect and acknowledgement of deeds. All in the order are considered equal in their agency in Valor.

??? abstract "Ranks"
    1. **Brother/Sister of Valor** Once initiated one is part of the brotherhood and named as such.
    2. **Knight-Star/Shining Knight.** Those who take an oath of fealty are Knights of the Shining Star and stand as equals in the onslaught of evil. They are adorned with a white cloak that has the symbol of the order over their hearts - a six pointed golden star.
    3. **High Paladin.** Leaders among the flock are identified by superiors and promoted to High Paladins.  They are expected to lead by example and be paragons of the beliefs of the Order. On the field they are marked with a red cross over the golden star on their uniform.
    4. **Lord Paladin.** Paladins that show a talent for politics and administration may be promoted from the ranks to become Lords. They are considered noble by the order, though their families are excluded from this. They are given a region to preside over where they are to manage the affairs of the Order and ambassadors and administrators.
    5. **Lord, High Commander.** A number of Paladins become High Commanders and serve as the primary council for the Order's affairs. They meet on occasion to discuss matters and attend to global situations, but for the most part they lead their appointed Lords to preside over a single region.
    6. **Holy Saint of the Five.** One individual, blessed by all the Five, is appointed the Order's Saint. Currently this honour falls to Saint Markus Hammerhand, a human Knight in his fifties. His duty is to be the voice of the Five in the mortal realms and guides the order in mission, crusade and evangelism.
