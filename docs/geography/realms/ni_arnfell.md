> The sky is painted in gold and crimson as the sun rises over the hilly horizon of the open plains. Rolling hills of grass and interspersed woods stretch out as far as the eye can see. Stone monoliths rising from beneath the ground stretching up toward the heavens. It is a land of open spaces, vast riches, and the humble folk that call it home.

The have a verdant ethos, almost tribal in nature, yet are do not shun from progress and the unknowns of new ideas. They live in tune with nature and have a strong tradition in fieldcraft, herbalism and hunting.

Very much influenced by the Dwarven Imperium which conquered the lands in the [Age of Stone](/history/ages/age_of_stone) they are hardy and hard working, often regarded as stoic and unmoving, but with a friendly, accepting demeanor.

??? abstract "Netherfell Mountains"
    The Netherfell Mountains flank the Toro Fields in the north, and together with the Twinspeak form an almost impassible border between the blissful plains and the unstable Skällcrag Dale to the north, where many Tainted kin reside. It is believed that somewhere in the heart of the mountain, an ancient dragon lies dormant.

??? abstract "Twinspeak Mountains"
    Rising above the walls of Eskold are the _Two Fingers of Ornim_, dual peaks facing off into the clouds. So called as those who attempt to climb to the top most often come face to face with the god of the grave. The range is shrouded in superstitions, the one more fanciful than the next, which prevents many of the barbaric tribes who dwell in the lands beyond it to cross.

??? abstract "Alpinstar Forest"
    To the Southern edge of the Toro fields lies the Alpinstar The centre of the forest has not been found to this day. The trees are variant and foreign to any others of the Ni'arnfell, believed to have been brought from afar thousands of years ago. No one ventures too deep into the grove, and even the Druids of the lands advise not to dwell in it's embrace for too long.


### The Pheagas Rise
The South of the Ni'arnfell is characterized by the unending waves of hills and gullies. Also known as the _Leopard Hills_ the area is most common for it's plethora of wildlife. Keeping East of the _Golden River_ and reaching the _Ferrovein_ at the far end, it is an area that developed primarily through ship trading. Merchants frequent the settlements on both rivers, as it travels even to the Realm of [Agaea](/geography/realms/agaea), [Menassim](/geography/realms/menassim) and [Casavano](/geography/realms/casavano).

Notable Locations

??? abstract "Mount Guinoroth"
    Surrounded by empty an stretch the Sentinel Spire of Guinoroth stands quiet against the skies. Desolate and far removed from civilization, not much is known about the range.

The gates of their forts are locked to all outsiders, even other Dwarves.

??? abstract "Javerlock"
    The Peak of Javerlock, a dormant volcano, holds the majority of the region's civilized society. Gold, Silver and even Mithril lies beneath the stone and the mines run deep into the earth. Tunnels connect the city of Mascalon, the primary hub for trade, with the Dwarven forts within the peaks.

??? abstract "Ashenvayne & Talonvale"
    Deep within the forests of the Dale dwells demons. Forgotten to the ages, an ancient ruin of the eons before lies within. The ancients ruled the Dale from two districts, which now gives the forests their names.

Surrounded by jagged and untamed waters, exposed to the turbulence of the deep oceans, the _Vagrant Straight_ and _Jade Coast_ see little peace. The city of Deupont stands there at the foot of the Gildenborne Mountain as a lighthouse against the rough seas. A halfway house to the passing traders who wish to claim the riches of the _Golden Trade Route_.
