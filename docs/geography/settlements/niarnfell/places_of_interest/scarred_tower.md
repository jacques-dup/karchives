> The Scarred Tower rises from above the Blackened Walls if the Inner City Districts. Seemingly carved from a single block of obsidian, the thin finger extends from the flanking cliffs to look upon the city below it.

The Scarred Tower is the political seat of power for the city of Eskold, in the Ni'arnfell realm. It serves as the council chambers for the city's _Council of Es_ and the _Sebi_ (regent). Its current occupant, Lord Arin Quetzquetzin, a Dwarf by most accounts (but actually a Lich), has it furnished with:

- a personal _Arcane Library and Workshop_,
- a _Meeting Hall_ for council meetings,
- several chambers for the highest ranked Mages of the city.
