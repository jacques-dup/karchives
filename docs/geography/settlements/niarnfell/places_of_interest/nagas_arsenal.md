The shop is a three-storey, stone building with the lower levels carved from the rock and overhangs into the Anvil Ward crevice. The inside is decorated with a tiled mosaic floor and is brightly lit by magical chandeliers.

The upper level has a shop front and the residence of the owners. The second level is storage and a workshop for specialist items, and on the lower level is a massive forge carved into the rock.

### Owner
The shop is owned and attended by a couple. Esme Morningfall is a 32 year old female human with cropped, curled, golden hair shaved on the right side and brown eyes. She has an exceptional tattoo of Manos Claye on her left arm and an elaborate tattoo of a dagger on her left foot.

Akan Magmabrew is a 212 year old male Dwarf with long, straight, gray hair and brown eyes. His skin is smooth and golden and he has an athletic, slim build for a Dwarf. His gray beard is tucked into his belt and his moustache is elegantly oiled and sculpted into two large curls.

### Wares
The Naga's arsenal specialize in masterwork weapons and armour of any kind. Akan is able to form steel with exquisite precision, even from descriptions or rough sketches. Esme, a jeweler by craft, is able to add adornments and decorations like no other.
