The carved entryway opens up into a large chamber, filled with stands and carts or merchants and traders who call the Lower Wards their home.  Asy you enter you see a large building, a single storey timber and brick construction, with a small fenced yard and dwarf-wrought iron tables and chairs.

From the windows shines an almost ethereal, blue glow, cast from magical torches inside and shining through a carved opening in the door that is shaped like a sword - a depiction of the inn's name.

Inside, a small dragon's skull hangs over the hearth, and a collection of exotic drinking vessels rests upon a long shelf behind a counter.

### Owner
The innkeeper is a slender male human named Andhert. He has long, wavy, gray hair and black eyes. A striking piercing adorns his right brow and he is never seen without his smoldering pipe.

- Common: Dwarven Residents, Merchants, Nobles
