The inn is a grand building of carved and decorated timber, resting partly in the branches of a large tree. It is known for it's entertainment schedule, where popular bards perform ever second night, and whole themes set on weekends.

Beverages are served by robed Elves and Half-Elves mostly, all keeping a silent and tempered demeanor, yet when the times comes for ruffians to be escorted out, they are revealed to all be trained as unarmed combatants.

Accommodations consist of several small rooms with beds and woolen mattresses, each with a personal chest and washing station.

### Owner
