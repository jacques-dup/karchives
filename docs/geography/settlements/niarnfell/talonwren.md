## Notable Sites

??? abstract "The Lighthouse District"
    At the western edge of town stands a great lighthouse, built with marble bricks and decorated with elaborate timber carvings, it is the busiest and most visited district of the town. Not that travellers aren't allowed inside the rest of the city. But the harsh attitudes the secluded elves have toward outsiders tend to make visitors tick to the places where they can leave again without much effort.

    Notable Establishments:

    - **Altadrien Caducetorium,** is a notable and well stocked wand and scroll shop, owned by Half-Elf couple Altadrien and Venentia Marlenorin.
    - **Covi's Mystical Emporium,** is a general trade store of a lewd male Elf named Covi. He checks each sale with a black rat named Athan.
    - **The Archer and Flagon,** a tavern an inn owned by a short female Human named Mera Farfellow. She can comprehends many languages and tends to speak in Dwarven most of the time.

    In the Northern part of the city is an enclosed compound known as the Tranquil Halls. It houses several shrines to [Vonryl Kethalon](../../../../religion/deities/vonryl_kethalon) in the form of monastery dojos as well as a few temples to a number of other deities.

??? abstract "The Golden Castle"
    The Senate house and court is situated in a large building at the crest of the hill. It is built with a sand coloured stone and decorated with gold and brass. It also houses _The Talons_ - law keepers and enforces of the Senate

??? abstract "The Ashen Grove"
    By the eastern wall, a garden once stood. Long before most can remember, a priestess of [Firna](../../../../religion/deities/firna) was slain within by burning it to the ground. Since then nothing has grown in the spot and it is said that the ghost of the priestess still haunts the ashen field.
