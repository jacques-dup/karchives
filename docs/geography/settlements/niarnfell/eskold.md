# Eskold
Eskold, or _Eskeld's Hold_ in full, rises from the mountainside. The black stone walls thrust into the face of a great cliff on the side of the Twinspeak. Silence falls on the lands blow, with only the soft cool wind swooping down the slopes. From far off a crow's caw breaks the stillness.

The whole of the city is walled within the raised stronghold of the mountain, partly carved from the rock and partly built outward onto the black stone fortifications. Within the inner sanctuary, multiple walled off districts form defendable choke points, categorized into two major parts - the _Inner City_ and the _Outer City_.

??? abstract "The Crimson Way"
    From the outer gates, a road has been constructed from a reddish, carved granite. Known as _The Crimson Way_, it snakes through the city districts as the supposed only path to the inner parts of the city. It runs all the way through each of the districts to the gate of the Scarred Tower at the center of the _Tower Ward_.

## The Inner City
The _Inner City_ lies at the heart of the mountain and spans across three levels. The upper level sits at the highest point of the fortress, towering above the Black Walls, with the lower wards carved from the rock itself. It is encased by a tall wall of the same blackened stone as the outer walls, aptly named _The Second Wall_, that sits right next to the natural cliffs of the mountain itself. A single gateway, named the _Last Stand_ sits in the middle of the wall, granting passage to the Lower Ward.

??? abstract "Tower Ward"
    Tower Ward is open to the sky, at the upper-most point of the city itself. The _Second Wall's_ crest forms its foundation. The space is open with wide, paved roads. Access to the ward is restricted and the single entryway is guarded by members of the _Scepterguard_.

??? abstract "Sanctum District"
    The Sanctum District is the upper floor of the underground portion of the city.  It sits on roughly the same level as the _Tower Ward_, but carved into the mountain. It's floor opens into a wide, elliptical space with buildings constructed around it's rim. At its center is a giant statue of [Ura](/religion/deities/ura), his outstretched hands holding aloft an orb of fire. It brings light and heat to the district, dimming by night and brightening by day.

??? abstract "Lower Ward"
    Below the _Sanctum District_ and roughly on the same elevation as the _Outer City_ lies the Lower Ward. It is a small area consisting of multiple carved tunnels and chambers that served as the main fortress of the city when it was founded. It provides residence for most of the city's Dwarven population and the city's nobility.

## The Outer City
The _Outer City_ sits on the main level of the fortress, still elevated from the entrances, on a plateau of sorts, forming a large open plane before the _Second Wall_.

??? abstract "Cathedral Court"
    The Cathedral Court is a small district compared to the other wards. It sits next to the gateway between the Outer City and the Lower Ward, and hosts a few residences along with most of the temple shrines of the city. The roads are wide and slanted at its edges granting citizens a better vantage point when viewing parades on celebration days.

??? abstract "Market Ward"
    The Market Ward is the largest of the Outer City districts and houses most of the common shops and trades the city produces and markets. It lies by the main entrance to the city for easy access.

??? abstract "Bells Ward"
    The Bells Ward flanks the _Market Ward_ by the main gates of the city. It is smaller than most, and raised slightly in elevation. Four tall towers mark its borders, with sentry posts on each to watch over the districts as well as the lands beyond the city walls. These days the buildings are purposed toward housing.

??? abstract "Anvil Ward"
    The Anvil Ward lies between the _Bell Ward_ and _Cathedral Court_, with the _Crimson Way_ dividing it from the _Market Ward_. The ward itself sits on a natural crevice, and is characterized by multiple hanging bridges of various heights and size, criss-crossing across the opening. Tunnels on the bottom layers dig into the rock to serve as mines and quarries to be used for the city's construction and reparing needs. The upper levels house many different shops, masons and smiths along with a number of residential buildings.

??? abstract "Village Ward"
    The Village Ward, or just _The Village_ for short lies beyond the _Market Ward_ and consists of hundreds of apartment-like dwellings constructed for residential use.

??? abstract "Council of Es"
    The Council of Es is a group of influential Woman who holds some sway over the rule of the city. They serve the leisure of _Sebi_ in name, but in practice they have most of the true power where the governance of the city is concerned.
