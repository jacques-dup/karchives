# Eskold
Eskold, or _Eskeld's Hold_ in full, rises from the mountainside. The black stone walls thrust into the face of a great cliff on the side of the Twinspeak. Silence falls on the lands blow, with only the soft cool wind swooping down the slopes. From far off a crow's caw breaks the stillness.

The whole of the city is walled within the raised stronghold of the mountain, partly carved from the rock and partly built outward onto the black stone fortifications. Within the inner sanctuary, multiple walled off districts form defendable choke points, categorized into two major parts - the _Inner City_ and the _Outer City_. Outside the Black Walls is an extension known as _Copper Town_, not part of the original city, but considered to be part of the Eskold holdings.

    From the outer gates, a road has been constructed from a reddish, carved granite. Known as _The Crimson Way_, it snakes through the city districts as the supposed only path to the inner parts of the city. It runs all the way through each of the districts to the gate of the Scarred Tower at the center of the _Tower Ward_.

## The Inner City
The _Inner City_ lies at the heart of the mountain and spans across three levels. The upper level sits at the highest point of the fortress, towering above the Black Walls, with the lower wards carved from the rock itself. It is encased by a tall wall of the same blackened stone as the outer walls, aptly named _The Second Wall_, that sits right next to the natural cliffs of the mountain itself. A single gateway, named the _Last Stand_ sits in the middle of the wall, granting passage to the Lower Ward.

??? abstract "Tower Ward"
    Tower Ward is open to the sky, at the upper-most point of the city itself. The _Second Wall's_ crest forms its foundation. The space is open with wide, paved roads. Access to the ward is restricted and the single entryway is guarded by members of the _Scepterguard_.

??? abstract "Sanctum District"
    The Sanctum District is the upper floor of the underground portion of the city.  It sits on roughly the same level as the _Tower Ward_, but carved into the mountain. It's floor opens into a wide, elliptical space with buildings constructed around it's rim. At its center is a giant statue of [Ura](/religion/deities/ura), his outstretched hands holding aloft an orb of fire. It brings light and heat to the district, dimming by night and brightening by day.

??? abstract "Lower Ward"
    Below the _Sanctum District_ and roughly on the same elevation as the _Outer City_ lies the Lower Ward. It is a small area consisting of multiple carved tunnels and chambers that served as the main fortress of the city when it was founded. It provides residence for most of the city's Dwarven population and the city's nobility.

??? abstract "Council of Es"
