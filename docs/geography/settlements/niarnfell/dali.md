The city of Dali is in constant political struggles. For the last decades it has been governed by Lady Josselyn as regent. Although she is fair and unbiased, keeping the to the traditions of the city and leading it toward prosperity, factions have emerged who want to take over its control to advance their own interests. The strongest of these being an group of Arcanists named _The Order of Selamiir_.

The city itself is divided into three main districts, _The Docks_, _The Steading_, and _The Keep_. It sits on the edge of the _Elvenrise_ mountain where the _Luneukii_ river mouths into the Golden Coast seas.

??? abstract "The Docks"
    The Docks forms the district closest to the sea, and spans across both sides of the river. It is home to most of the commercial establishments of the city and sees many trade vessels stop by as part of _The Golden Run_ trade route.

??? abstract "The Steading"
    The Steading forms the central part of the city and is the primary residential district. It is characterized by its many gardens and groves that are kept and groomed by the citizens. Many of the residences use the natural growth of the groves to form walls and walkways through the district.

??? abstract "The Keep"
    At the foot of the Elvenrise mountain lies The Keep.  Not made of stone or brick, the structure serving as the council chambers of the regent is a living structure. It is partly formed by magic, shaped from the natural rocks and earth, and partly formed from the natural growth of three large oak trees. As only the old Elven magic, now forgotten, could - The Keep is a symbol of an earlier, more aggressive and more ambitious age of Elven history. Along with the lessons learned from such philosophies.
