Timber is a peaceful settlement of a mostly Human population. They associate with the governance of Port Mere as a Narr Confederate, but as other affiliates remain mostly self governed. Fish and logging are the primary trades of the inhabitants, although being considered part of the _Golden Run_ trade route, they see many visitors and with it a multitude of trade.

## Notable Sites

??? abstract "Fish Markets"
    Timber has built quite a large dock and harbour, mainly to enable larger trade vessels to lay anchor. Surrounding the docks are many food stalls and a number of inns where these travelers may stay and be entertained, a fact that has led to Timber becoming a minor tourist destination. These attractions are colloquially referred to as the _Timber Fish Markets_.

    Notable Establishments:

    - **The Cursed Axe,** tavern and inn owned by a young female Halfling named Ecix Wesor.
    - **The Foolish King,** tavern owned by an aesthetic female Half-Elf named Mora, known for her use of talismans and protective trinkets.
    - **The Bear and Dragon,** mead hall of an aged male Dwarf named Dainan Evenhand, a retired alchemist.
    - **The Jester's Lodge,** a tavern and theatre owned by a male halfling named Piersym.

    At the centre of town is a large, open, cobblestone courtyard. Over the years it has become a regular exhibition spot for artists and tourists. Next to the courtyard but considered part of the Square is a well maintained garden, known as the most romantic spot in all the _Golden Run_ - at least if you ask any of the Timber residents.

## Surrounding Area

    A large forest, though small when compared to the colossal _Vahlen_ across the river, lies the Merenglade. It is a peaceful place, though locals do not advise venturing in there without a guide as the trees form tight paths that can easily become a maze. It is rumoured that inside the glade there lies an old Elf ruin, but no one has been able to find it.
