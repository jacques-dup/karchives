## Motivation and Goals
The Order's primary function is to register, regulate and school the practitioners of magic within the city. Through the rendering of services and sales, they have become quite wealthy and influential within the city of Dali.

Their current aim is to sway public opinion enough to become the ruling council of the city. That way they can not only have policy pursue their own interest, but also have a strong foothold to branch out to other locations.

## Resources
Spellcasters who are worth their weight are hard to come by. Those who have the talent to actually excel and develop the institution are even rarer. What the order lacks in active members they make up for in influence and favours.  The true power they have are from their archwizard council.
