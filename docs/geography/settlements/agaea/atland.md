Flanking Cesmeir Lake on the Eastern side, Atlan thrives in a barren world.  Lead by Orutor Warrug, industry sprawls from the vast salt trade from the sandy salt pans on the lake shores.   More so, Atland thrives on ingenuity and invention.

Dwellings are spread out along the shore, with no wall required for safety.  One life line, the Salt Road leads away and toward civilization.  All around the sun burns out any potential attackers from the surrounding dunes.
