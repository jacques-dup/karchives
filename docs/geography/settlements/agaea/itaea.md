Itaea is a mining town, about two day's travel to the South-East of Atenaa.  This mostly Human settlement is lead by a young human diplomat named Quin Twoorb (adopted son of the Holy Judicator).

Many precious metals originate from Itaea, but mostly silver.  The harsh conditions of the mountainside, and the dangers of the deep cavern has kept the town small in size, seeking out only the hardiest of folk to dwell there.  As such there are many a Dwarven resident, much more than in the capital.

A contingent of Dragon Guards keep watch in the town, to protect the supply of metals, patrolling the roads and rooting out bandits.
