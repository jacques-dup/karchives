# Port Thauma
Port Thauma is a hostile place, locked in a never ending game of power.  The lines of succession is arbitrary, and those who prove themselves resourceful can find themselves in favour of the throne.

Buildings are spacious, elegent and designed with Elfish sensibility in mind, mimicking the styles of Kethraelm in the North.

Currently, the port has seen a fairly long standing ruler, Lady Enwenen Lantaththar.  She is ruthless and unflinching in her rule, eliminating competition and keeping the trading guilds in line.

The city itself is a bustling metropolis, dominated by Elfish elegance and graceful precision of craft.  Anything is fair game in this city, and business is a game like all other things in life.
