# Fort Kolar
Fort Kolar is one of the last remaining strongholds in Agaea, still governed by its noble Dwarven bloodlines.  They govern in accordance to the laws of the Holy Judicator, and open their gates to all races, including Elves, at the word of the Divine Judge.

No Dragon guard can be found here, and law is kept by the Shieldsworn – Lord [Uril Earthdelver](#UrilEarthdelver)’s own militia.  Tension can be felt when you walk the streets, and although Elves are allowed to move freely in the stronghold, none truly do.
