# Cypragovia
Cypragovia is a fairly new settlement quickly growing to become a sizable town.  With the discovery of a small Mithril vein, the town is filled to the brim with aspiring fortune seekers from all over the dessert.

Out of necessity to keep order, the Holy Judicator has recently appointed [Endinwel Mithanmae](#EndinwelMithanmae), an Elf noble of note to become the town’s mayor – a move that sits favourably with the Elvin lords of Port Thauma to the north.

With the Elfish influence, the town has blossomed into a mix of beautiful architecture and prosperous trade, a melting pot for the cultures of Agaea.
