Notice The archives is a work in progress and is by no means close to complete at this stage. But I felt like there was enough there to start getting the creative juices flowing for some fellow, like-minded Dungeon Masters. That, and my D&D group needs a reference Another Notice There will be quite a few broken links to non-existent pages. As I write I tend to include the linking markdown but only create the pages at a later stage. The Lore The Archives chronicles the lore of Aklatoria , a fantasy world of magic and fantastical creatures. In Aklatoria the humble Kobold, kin to the Dragons of Old, are the best and most meticulous lore keepers of the realms. Their libraries contain the secrets of creation from the mythical histories of the world, the gods who claim dominion, the magic and science of the cosmos, and the cultures and creeds of its inhabitants. The Journey thus far Aklatoria started out, probably around the early 2000's, as a D&D campaign. Through the years my DM's notebook grew and ideas from all my friends got incorporated into what is now this. We played many games, not only on this realm, but on the official campaign settings too. Recently I decided to take on the colossal task of digitizing my notes.. and there's a lot! I decided to do it in this form. My main consideration was that my players should be able to see what I capture in this wiki, so that they too have a better resource to create characters and stories for our D&D games. So, DISCLAIMERS and LICENSING: The content you see here is my own creative ramblings. I don't mind if you want to use any of the ideas written within it for your own D&D campaigns without telling me. But if you want to use some (or all) of what you find in here for any commercial projects, chat to me first so I can give you permission. Officially and Technically speaking, I publish this under NO LICENSE , which means copying redistributing and modifying is not permitted, but only for commercial uses. For personal use, you can use use it AS IS, and MODIFY to your liking. This might change in the future, but I don't feel like the project is fleshed out enough to be considered for commercial use.","title":"The Kobold Archives Codex"},{"location":"#the-kobold-archives-codex","text":"Welcome to the Kobold Archives, a creative project of fantasy lore intended to be used as a homebrew role playing campaign setting for D&D or Pathfinder.

And endless shifting between Order and Chaos. Mysterious powers from beyond the veil of space and time influencing reality like a dark force creating rippling echoes throughout the universe. Central to the dualism, is the ability to tap into these forces, and channel its power to endless possibilities. The nature of these powers are known, mapped in lore, but to say there is any being that truly knows its limits, or even its purpose, is to profess foolishness. Cosmological Concepts Magic Planes of Existence The first beings of Aklatoria penned what they called the Great Myth of Creation and it lends itself well to explaining the dualisms of reality. Aevum was a two faced god. One side was without features or expression: the embodiment of his laws. And the Laws he infused into his creation. The other was dynamic and ever changing: the embodiment of chaos and ultimate potential. The two sides on which the cosmology is based are the two extremes of Order and Chaos. Good and Evil has no influence in the way the cosmos is structured. Morality has no meaning in its form. Creation has rules, yes, defined by the ultimate expression of Law . But it also has unending potential, defined by the ultimate expression of Change . In the Realms of Aevum, the plains of existence overlap with each other through gateways. These gateways manifest as Sources of Power on Aklatoria, by which beings can travel between them through the Myst. The material realm is known as Aklatoria. It is a stable realm with a relatively small amount of Myst influence compared to some of the other realms. It is therefore a realm of infinite possibility, in perfect balance between Order and Chaos. In close proximity to Aklatoria are the realms of Aegis and Nox , manifesting as the two moons of Aklatoria. Aegis is a realm of order and law. On it resides many cities of outsiders who are in a constant state of flux against the creatures of Nox. Nox is in turn a realm of chaos and entropy, standing as opposition against the creatures of Aegis. Good and evil plays no role in the origins of these realms. Beneath the material realm is a place contained primarily by the seeping through of the Myst, called the Nether . It is part of Aklatoria, Aegis, Nox and the Myst, linking these three realms, and the primary reason why they are able to influence each other so greatly. Beings from each realm can freely cross over into the Nether, but cannot enter any realm beyond their own without aid from that side. Across the eons the Nether became a battleground between Aegis and Nox, in order to increase their power over Aklatoria and the material realm.","title":"Cosmology"},{"location":"cosmology/#cosmology","text":"The cosmos is built on dualism.

Their power seeps into the soils of many worlds, emanating in clouds of raw power. Those who once knew it by nature named it Myst , the Ethereal force that binds us all to the will of the gods. Magic in Aklatoria is plentiful and seemingly endless in nature. It is found everywhere, and in some cases societies have thrived though its universal application. But it is a resource bound by rules - the physics, if you will, of the cosmos. Drawing its power to shape the world has consequences, and it is not certain if even Maia , the goddess of the Arcane even knows or understands them all. The Myst The substance of magic, if it can be called as such, is labelled as Myst. In part the same \"thing\" that makes up the transient plane of Myst Aether , but also a \"substance\" of sorts on its own. It can manifest as smokey tendrils the eye can see, invisible sparkling fixtures or even tangible crystals. The physical representation of the Myst is endless. The Myst substance has locked inside of it the patterns of the cosmos, mirrored to some extent in physical form. These patterns can be unraveled by skilled Mages to produce magical effects, commonly known as spells. The shapes and forms of The Myst are endless and ever changing. It flows and shifts, almost as if alive, or being driven by a collective consciousness. It is eternal and yet limited. It is a weave of potential surrounding all creation and the fuel for it, in itself. What is known as fact though, is that the Myst manifests in physical objects, known as Sources of Power . These objects or places take on som of the physical properties of the Myst Substance and serve as a strong bond between the Material realm and the transient plane it originates from. The Sources of Power The sources of power are physical objects or locations where the Myst is anchored to Aklatoria. Strange things can happen around these Sources, yet history shows that they bring balance to the natural world. The strongest of the Sources are the Great World Trees . Common Source Examples World Trees Celestial Bodies (The Sun, Aegis , Nox , etc.) Divine Source Practitioners The flow of the Myst can be harnessed by mortals by means of linking themselves to a Source of power. Theoretically any being can be bound to such a source and become a wielder of magical power. But only some are able to attune themselves to a truly powerful source. The road to becoming a practitioner begins with the binding. Different organizations have different ceremonies and steps required for this binding. It can be forced through a Magical Ritual, or spontaneously happen due to an unknown amount of factors, including pacts with gods or outsiders, consuming or absorbing the power of a magical object or activating a dormant bloodline link. This bind manifests in various ways, but typically has some physical representation, know as the \"Myst Soul\". These can include familiars, bonded items, birthmarks, a Holy relic, or even physical traits like a halo or glowing eyes. But in truth this physical manifestation is merely a symbol of the binding and can even be changed.

At night, when the Sun's blinding light has faded, you can see the constellations of the outer worlds in the heavens. But Aklatoria is a place of flux, where the nature of the cosmos is most profound. It stands as the pinnacle, a anchor of sorts, at the centre. And its Great World Trees bind all of creation to it. The nature of the universe, the Myst and Magic is balance. Without the balance, there is no cosmos. And Aklatoria, the prime Plane of Existence and Substance is the scales responsible for that balance. Many cosmic planes exist beyond, and a number of them inside, or parallel to the Material realm. These are categorized into groups, depending on their nature. Transient Planes Beneath, parallel, universal, encompassing. The link between the tangible realms require a \"vessel\" or sorts, or rather, a \"glue\" that binds these places together. As soap bubbles cling together on the surface, forming an absolute, yet fragile and shifting boundary. Known Transient Planes: Myst Aether: The Ethereal plane of Magic. Echo realms These planes exist in parallel to the Material realm and to some extent form part of it. They connect through the roots of the World trees and as such, the borders between them are often blurred. Known Echo Realms: Nether: The parallel battlegrounds of Law and Chaos. Also known as Limbo . Sheol, the Soul Forge: : The core of the world, the primal source of its mystical powers. The place where the essences of life rests. Gaia: The heart of the world, where the primordial essence of nature is bound. Inner Circle The Inner Circle groups together the planes in close cosmic proximity to Aklatoria and the Material Realm.

Ordinia: The Floating Castle of Selflessness and Justice, circling the Sun and home to the Divine Lawbringers. Crevatorus: The Scattered Debris of The Void Seed, filled with deep holes and gateways to the Abyss. Outer Circle: The Outer Circle groups together the planes that are spread far from Aklatoria.

Far in the heavens above lies Aklatoria, a bright and vibrant contrast to the white sands at your feet. The Silver Moon is a strange land bound by strange laws. The surface is dominated by great stretches of white sand. Windless skies keeps it constant and nearly perfectly flat. Every piece of natural growth seems calculated, and sculpted according to a predetermined pattern. Great crystals spire parallel into the sky, \"growing\" naturally to form perfect caverns where the native creatures live. Everything has a purpose in Aegis, and nothing is left to chance. Aegis Prime Ania stood there before the Glass Gates of Aegis Prime. Stern eyes looked upon the Elf as she approached with a tentative stride. She had in her possession a Silver Seal, which meant she could pass freely. But a gallery of Angels and Devils flanking her path menacingly did little to ease her steps. Passing through the precipice she paused, awestruck by the sight of the Great City in the Clouds. Alien structures of glass and crystal, mixed with foreign stones and steel, weaved into flowing shapes. Tall growths that seemed like trees grew in circular helixes, with softly glowing canopies of seemingly sentient stalks and brushes. Details Politics: Bureaucracy Alignment: Absolute Lawful Population: 7 000 000 Authority: Dominus Stasis Angelicae At the core of the plane lies a great city of Angels and Devils. Towering over the vast fields of white, its central spire houses the Silver Court, parliament of the Dimensional Beings and central seat of all Cosmic Law. It serves as the homestead of Martivir , the Dragon Lord of All Justice. Mortals seldom are allowed to enter the Gates of Aegis Prime, and needs to seek passage from one of the Great Noble Houses of Aegis. These ancient noble houses are able to grant a bearer a Silver Seal, granting them passage into the city for a single purpose: an audience with the Dominus Stasis Angelicae. Houses of Nobility The Noble houses of Aegis consist of lineage factions that have existed form millennia, led by the most noble and pure bloodlines of Lawful Outsiders. Notable Houses House Hannos Known as the Watchers of Angelicae, the House of Hannos is one of the most influential organizations on Aegis. Bent on justified and lawful rule over Aegis and that of the cosmos, they are headed by the patriarch of the Hannos familia, an immortal Archon of the Triumvirate, though both celestials and fiends make up their ranks. House Michae Known as the Seven Suns, the House of Michae serve the needs of their patron god, Lord Aster . Believed to be born of the Sun god himself, the seven Solar brothers that stand at the head of the House are known as the Sons fo Michael, their Angelic father, the bringer of light. House Mephisto Followers bound to the charismatic devil Lord Mephistopheles become the House of Mephisto. His powers and influence is great in Aegis prime and he stands at the head of the Aegissian Armies. House Black Asmon Lord Asmodeus, adopted son of The Dark Lord Assador , oversees his father's interests in the political scene of the Dominus Stasis Angelicae. It is said that Asmodeus was shown a glimpse of the secrets from the Void, giving him otherworldly insight into the minds of others. Laws Aegis in built on the concept of Law, and the application of law forms part of the cosmic substance of the plane itself. It drives all action with a justifiable and appropriate reaction according to the cosmic laws written down in the Central, Spire Temple of Aegis prime. There are thousands of laws and bylaws written into the stone tablets that form its foundation. But most important are the laws concerning mortals of Aklatoria and beyond. Laws of Transvergeance Laws pertaining the the travel between realms for Outsiders are captures into a set of Laws known as the Laws of Transvereange. In summary it states that no outsider may travel to the material realm without a host or anchor in place, sourced by a native of the plane. It also states the rules for travel into the Nether Realms and the rules of engagement should any Noxians or mortals be encountered there. Laws of Arbitration Mortals may only enter the realm of Aegis if they possess an invitation in the form of a Silver Seal. These can only be created by the Noble Houses of Aegis and its sole purpose is to bring a mortal to the Courts of Aegis Prime for a cosmic ruling of some kind. Mortals who are discovered are captured and will most likely spend the remainder of their life in and out of holdings where they are to pass through the convoluted legislative processes of the Aegissian courts. Executions are common, though there are cases where mortals were sent to different planes as convict labourers or forces conscription into the Aegissian army. Gateways Being part ot the Inner Circle Planes , Aegis is cosmically tied to Aklatoria, and many gateways exist between dimensions through the Nether Realm . There are no known gateways directly between the two, and it is written in the Laws of Transvergeance , that no direct gateway between the Inner Circle planes can exist and can only be bound through the Nether.

It might be some time before they find a precipice to step forth into the Nether Realm. She wasn't sure how she would read the signs. But to get to her destination beyond the veils of the material realm, she had to pass into the planar echo first. Then she had to seek the battlements of the Seven Suns beyond, to request passage through one of the planar gates. The Nether Realm lies parallel in reality to the material world. It echoes and spills into reality similar to the Ripples of the Myst Aether , but deep underground where the earth is anchored to its axis. Its features mimic that tof the deep, cavernous underground, opening up into massive caves, lava pools and black stone. Throughout the Nether Realm, gateways open to the Inner Circle planes, naturally forming and anchored in space. This enables denizens of both Aegis and Nox to freely venture into the Nether Realm. It has caused the Nether to be a continuous battleground between the forces of cosmic Law and Chaos . The land itself takes on some properties of the realms it connects to, the essences of all seeping into the fabric of the Nether Realm. And so the eternal clash of Order and Entropy is echoed onto the Material Plane as well. Shallow Nether The places that overlap into the deep underground of Aklatoria is known as the Shallows , or the Shallow Nether . It mostly resembles the natural underground of the Material Plane , with only the occasional anomaly revealing the true nature of the area. Outsiders may roam these areas, though their numbers are little. Magic flourishes and Ripples are plentiful, but especially where the presence of Chaos is strongest it becomes unpredictable and volatile. Deep Nether As one ventures deeper into the Nether Realm there is no doubt as to the nature of the location. Myst seeps into the planar echo, and seems to glow visibly in some places, whipping tendrils of prismatic ribbons or black sludge around the rocks and other features. Massive caverns opens up to a starless ceiling, the walls seemingly carved smooth by an unknown sentience into unnatural patterns. Stones are scarred black from non-existent fires and strange, shadows seem to jump and shift, gurgling and bubbling as they pass through the solid stone. Citadels Areas where the two opposing planes of Aegis or Nox meld into the Nether Realm take on some of the features of the interlinked dimension. The presence of the seeping realities become strongholds of the occupying force, commonly referred to as Citadels . These Citadels may become structures resembling the cities of their origin, and are named and mapped by the two warring factions.

It might be some time before they find a precipice to step forth into the Nether Realm. She wasn't sure how she would read the signs. But to get to her destination beyond the veils of the material realm, she had to pass into the planar echo first. Then she had to seek the battlements of the Seven Suns beyond, to request passage through one of the planar gates. The Nether Realm lies parallel in reality to the material world. It echoes and spills into reality similar to the Ripples of the Myst Aether , but deep underground where the earth is anchored to its axis. Its features mimic that tof the deep, cavernous underground, opening up into massive caves, lava pools and black stone. Throughout the Nether Realm, gateways open to the Inner Circle planes, naturally forming and anchored in space. This enables denizens of both Aegis and Nox to freely venture into the Nether Realm. It has caused the Nether to be a continuous battleground between the forces of cosmic Law and Chaos .

Fish and logging are the primary trades of the inhabitants, although being considered part of the Golden Run trade route, they see many visitors and with it a multitude of trade. Notable Sites Fish Markets Timber has built quite a large dock and harbour, mainly to enable larger trade vessels to lay anchor. Surrounding the docks are many food stalls and a number of inns where these travelers may stay and be entertained, a fact that has led to Timber becoming a minor tourist destination. These attractions are colloquially referred to as the Timber Fish Markets . Notable Establishments: The Cursed Axe, tavern and inn owned by a young female Halfling named Ecix Wesor. The Foolish King, tavern owned by an aesthetic female Half-Elf named Mora, known for her use of talismans and protective trinkets. The Bear and Dragon, mead hall of an aged male Dwarf named Dainan Evenhand, a retired alchemist. The Jester's Lodge, a tavern and theatre owned by a male halfling named Piersym. The Square At the centre of town is a large, open, cobblestone courtyard. Over the years it has become a regular exhibition spot for artists and tourists. Next to the courtyard but considered part of the Square is a well maintained garden, known as the most romantic spot in all the Golden Run - at least if you ask any of the Timber residents.

Surrounding the docks are many food stalls and a number of inns where these travelers may stay and be entertained, a fact that has led to Timber becoming a minor tourist destination. These attractions are colloquially referred to as the Timber Fish Markets . Notable Establishments: The Cursed Axe, tavern and inn owned by a young female Halfling named Ecix Wesor. The Foolish King, tavern owned by an aesthetic female Half-Elf named Mora, known for her use of talismans and protective trinkets. The Bear and Dragon, mead hall of an aged male Dwarf named Dainan Evenhand, a retired alchemist. The Jester's Lodge, a tavern and theatre owned by a male halfling named Piersym. The Square At the centre of town is a large, open, cobblestone courtyard. Over the years it has become a regular exhibition spot for artists and tourists. Next to the courtyard but considered part of the Square is a well maintained garden, known as the most romantic spot in all the Golden Run - at least if you ask any of the Timber residents.","title":"Notable Sites"},{"location":"geography/settlements/niarnfell/timber/#surrounding-area","text":"Merenglade A large forest, though small when compared to the colossal Vahlen across the river, lies the Merenglade.

They had rejected their old gods and were at the time in an all out war against them. The Runestone enabled a group of them to ascend to divinity themselves. They are known as the Erigrim . The Discovery of the Runestone The God Wars were different for the Dwarven people. Not only did they fight a war on multiple fronts, they were fighting against what many believed at the time, to be divine beings - The \"Bellan\" (Old Ones) . During their first confrontation with their old gods, the Dwarves discovered an artifact called \"Thorgen\" , or sometimes The \"Yurrir\" (The Runestone). This artifact in time had a group of Dwarven leaders ascend to divinity, and enabled the Dwarves to unlock the secrets of Rune Magic, giving them an incredible edge in the battles of the God Wars. Their triumphs uttered in a new age of Dwarven civilization. The myth of how they discovered the Runestone are told as part of the Genesis of the Erigrim The Global Dwarven Empire With the newfound power of the Runestone, the Dwarves found their capital and called it Agamoria in reverence to their patron Saint Agamor. Using Rune Magic to carve the walls of the city, they built a stronghold that could survive a direct onslaught from the Reilagg and house an army of 10 000 for months. Their new found strength also had them expand. They started winning battles against the Old Gods , as well as any new enemy they faced. The First Rune Army marched across Kalibora until they reached the ocean - and they built ships to cross it reaching new lands. Their empire grew vast and they spread their fortresses across Aklatoria. With their conquest they brought commerce, culture and technology, uplifting primitives and crushing competition. Unbreakable Elves As the Empire approached the unending forests of the North, they were met with the Elvin barbarians, a foe who possessed a battle prowess they have never before seen, and powerful magic to rival their runes. The Elves were ruthless in battle and the Dwarven expansion halted. Soon the Elves rallied in numbers and pushed back the Dwarven lines. They formed an unbreakable barrier, no matter the flood of troops the Empire was sending to enforce the lines. The battle became a war, and the war soon escalated into a power struggle between Runes and Elvin Blood Magic . The Fall of the Empire Records speak of the day when Nox eclipsed Aegis, and the realms were thrown into chaos. The cosmological event was foreseen by the Elves, attuned to the Myst-realm. They planned for the day to come, and when it was upon them they threw all their might at the center of the Dwarven power: the Tree of Bonaduic . The ancient tree was said to be the primary root of the Runestone's power in Aklatoria. The Elves destroyed the Tree, and what followed was utter destruction. The cosmic balance had been upset and creation shook the earth and heavens. Stars fell from the sky and the land where the Tree had stood turned barren and dry. The war against the Elves proved too much for the Empire to sustain. The earth was revolting against their conquest and they fled back to their homeland. Most of the Dwarven armies returned to Kalibora, and the realms were ripe for the taking.

Their new found strength also had them expand. They started winning battles against the Old Gods , as well as any new enemy they faced. The First Rune Army marched across Kalibora until they reached the ocean - and they built ships to cross it reaching new lands. Their empire grew vast and they spread their fortresses across Aklatoria.

The Elves were ruthless in battle and the Dwarven expansion halted. Soon the Elves rallied in numbers and pushed back the Dwarven lines. They formed an unbreakable barrier, no matter the flood of troops the Empire was sending to enforce the lines.

The cosmological event was foreseen by the Elves, attuned to the Myst-realm. They planned for the day to come, and when it was upon them they threw all their might at the center of the Dwarven power: the Tree of Bonaduic . The ancient tree was said to be the primary root of the Runestone's power in Aklatoria. The Elves destroyed the Tree, and what followed was utter destruction. The cosmic balance had been upset and creation shook the earth and heavens. Stars fell from the sky and the land where the Tree had stood turned barren and dry. The war against the Elves proved too much for the Empire to sustain. The earth was revolting against their conquest and they fled back to their homeland. Most of the Dwarven armies returned to Kalibora, and the realms were ripe for the taking.","title":"The Fall of the Empire"},{"location":"history/ages/age_of_stone/#list-of-historic-ages","text":"Age of Seeding The Time of Turmoil Age of Stone Age of the Stars The Long Winter Age of the Sun","title":"List of Historic Ages"},{"location":"history/ages/age_of_the_stars/","text":"The Age of the Stars Elvin Dominion The Elves of old were as fierce as they were intelligent and the marching tide of Dwarves from the south united them in battle.

According to the Kobold Archives the oldest myth of creation is recorded in The Book of Arath Aev . It is believed to have been a holy book of the Neliavth people, the oldest civilization of Aklatoria, now a mere memory manifesting in scattered ruins across the world. The Book, actually consists of five texts, each describing a different time period. It is written in poetic edda and steeped in religious dogma. The following extracts could be reconstructed from various sources and translated. No full copy has ever been found. Book 1 - Genesis: In the beginning Aevum created the universe. There was no plan or purpose. It merely was, as the most divine of wills cannot be without existing. It was an empty shell; a void of potential. Within it incubated the spirit of all things that can be, and will be and ever has been. For time is no master to the creation of Aevum. The shell was a vessel for all things to be made true. The spirit grew vast and lit up the void with a burst of unfathomable energy. For the briefest of moments the stasis was no more than a thought. The structure broke apart and ripped across the void to bring forth many stars and uncountable worlds. Each of these was the true reflection of Aevum's potential, yet each of these was unique as Aevum is all possible things and none of them at once. In some of these Aevum was made into being. His spirit became substance and his name became known. In this world The People was made. And in this world it is written down. Book two - The Old ones: Aevum-of-two-faces gave birth to his first daughter and called her Gaia. She was half stasis and half entropy, but none of these at all. The stern face of the father loved her laws and blessed his child with eternity and substance. The mad face of the father loved her chaos and blessed his child with tempest storms from core to sky. He made for her a companion, Jarla the Great, a titan of the skies. But Jarla was dim-witted as he had not been born from Aevum's essence, but from his magic. He wandered amongst the stars in fascination to their brilliance. So Aevum gave birth to the twins Aegis and Nox, each the opposite of the other. One stern and one mad, like the two faces of the father himself. He looked upon them and loved them both, but felt them incomplete without the other. For them he made a pet, Mekla the Great, a serpent to circle the world. But Mekla had a fire inside her that could not be tamed and she spent her time trying to cool her body in the oceans of Gaia. The twins grew envious of their older sister and soon started fighting amongst themselves. Aevum grew disappointed with them and returned to the void from which he came, to join his brothers in the beyond. But opening a gateway to the void left a hole in creation. It drew in the stars around it creating a great darkness at the edge of the cosmos. Book three - The birth of Arath: Mekla, spending most of her time on Gaia, became fond of the first sister and they spent many ages conversing. The fire in the serpent kept on burning, however, and she had to leave in order to cool off in the oceans. In an attempt to get back at their sister out of envy, the twins proposed a plan. Aegis would use her law to give the titan Jarla a singular purpose. And Nox would use her chaos to fuel his desires. Then he would be able to cut out the fire inside the serpent and relieve Mekla of her agony. Gaia and Mekla agreed, never knowing that the twins intended for the serpent to die from the ordeal. But something which they did not expect happened. Jarla cut open the serpent and pulled from her an orb of fire. It burned in the sky and gave light to Gaia from the heavens. The brilliance shone so bright that the twins had to shun away from it and they went to hide in the shadows behind their sister. But not all was well with Mekla. Her fire was gone and with it her desires. She fell into a deep melancholy and went back to the oceans of Gaia. The first daughter of Aevum felt sorry for her companion and sent Jarla to console her in the depths. The union of the titan and the serpent brought forth a new pair of races. One of the titan, who claimed the lands on Gaia as their home. They were called the people of Arath. The other of the serpent, who roamed the skies above the oceans and beyond. They were called Draco. Book four - The First war: The peoples of Arath had many children but their honour was carried by the Neliavth. It was they who embodied the true spirit of Aevum-the-lost, their creator and great grandfather. The Drakes, however, grew restless over time, their mother still lost to the oceans since their birth. They had no purpose other than her resurrection from the depths. A thousand times over and a thousand years hence, the sister Nox played her role, and the Dragons were driven mad with longing. They roared and spew their fire and acid to the lands below. Their lightning rained down on the people of Arath. From it came the war of a thousand years, where the sky burned red and the oceans boiled to steam. From the misty waters came the Mother of Dragons, her children rallying to her cry. And from her burning magic came the Ethdarin, our greatest loss and our biggest gain. The people of Arath would never again be the same as their ultimate question was answered by their mother.

There was no plan or purpose. It merely was, as the most divine of wills cannot be without existing. It was an empty shell; a void of potential. Within it incubated the spirit of all things that can be, and will be and ever has been. For time is no master to the creation of Aevum. The shell was a vessel for all things to be made true. The spirit grew vast and lit up the void with a burst of unfathomable energy. For the briefest of moments the stasis was no more than a thought. The structure broke apart and ripped across the void to bring forth many stars and uncountable worlds. Each of these was the true reflection of Aevum's potential, yet each of these was unique as Aevum is all possible things and none of them at once. In some of these Aevum was made into being. His spirit became substance and his name became known. In this world The People was made.

He had friends amongst the spirits of the earth and often made gifts for them, but not all the spirits held a love for \u00c4run. They were vindictive and chaotic at heart, craving destruction. Some of the more mischievous spirits challenged his skill and strength, claiming that he could never make something of true value to them. But \u00c4run was stubborn and rose up to the challenge.

Literature and Knowledge The language of the Neliavth is named Vestii - a logophonetic system akin to cuniform, with some additional symbols that were used for common words or specific meanings. Their mathematical system is 12 base, using unique symbols as count indicators and other symbols indicating the major intervals of 12, along with specific ways to indicate advanced operators such as multiplication or powers. Their legacy is one of obscure and illogical magics, as well as advanced clockwork inventions. Most of the ruins that have been found indicate no residential purposes, but rather the pursuit of some experimental magical or inventive goal. These are often so otherworldly and foreign that modern day scholars never find out its true purposes. Especially since no coherent link between the purposes of these facilities can be found. Cultures The name Neliavth was not given to the society by modern scholars, but rather, it was discovered as a term used by the ancients to refer to themselves. From various sources there seems to have existed at least four different factions within this society. Often the references to these seem so distinct that it is believed that they might even have been of different species or at least sub-variants of the same race. The four factions identified were named by the Neliavth as, the: Lauraninth ( ) - Translated as the \"Tribes\" , and believed to be the first of the Neliavth cultures to emerge. Ameth ( ) - Translated as \"Warriors\" , and believed to have been a warlike faction that splintered from the Lauraninth . Vestath ( ) - Translated as \"Empire (dwellers)\" , and believed to have been the culture responsible for most of the ruins found in the modern day. Ethdarin ( ) - Translated as \"Risen\" , with only a few references found to them, they are thought to be the culture responsible for the Vanishing of the Neliavth from Aklatoria. Religion References to higher beings are common in Neliavth sources. They seem to have had a trilinear belief system, but with a monotheistic focus on one creator-god. These beings are references in Vestii as Yuahijo ( ). This creator is referenced as \"Aevum\" , personified as creation itself. Aevum had two faces, one of chaos and one of order, but his being, according to the Neliavth writings had three parts. \"Stasis\" ( ) was his one face, the face of order. \"Chaos\" ( ) was his other face, the face of entropy. Lastly, was \"Substance\" ( ), the power within him giving life to creation. Though Aevum was the primary god of the Neliavth, there are references to more Yuahijo (elder gods) known. One called \"Shael\" , referenced as the god of the Stars, as well as \"R\u00e4nn\" , the god of terror and antithesis to Aevum. Of R\u00e4nn is known the second most, also with a being of three. His being consisted of \"Entropy\" ( ), \"Hate\" ( ), and \"Darkness\" ( ). But references to his liking have not yet been found. Though knowledge of the Neliavth religion is rare amongst the modern scholars, those who have studied the ancients believe that these entities, or \"Elder Gods\", are associated to the Void at the end of Space and Time. Disappearance Throughout Neliavth writings are references of disappearance, and the concept seems to play a significant role in their society. The first mentioning of disappearance is in reference to their gods. According to Neliavth myth, at some point in their history, around the time the Ameth faction spilt from the major society, perhaps a short time before it, their god Aevum retreated into the Void he came from before creating the universe. Reasons for his retreat varies from source to source, but most prominent found in the Book of Arath Aev , stating that he grew disappointed with his creation. The second reference and defining element of Neliavth culture is of the disappearance of the Neliavth themselves. In the last chapter of the Book of Arath Aev, it is noted that the Ethdarin had to make the ultimate sacrifice during a war with the ancient dragons. Their action is what caused their disappearance, but also their salvation. Many theories exist about what these references mean, including the mundane and the farfetched. Some examples say the Neliavth caused a great extinction and thus an age of peace before the lower races became aware. Others believe the Neliavth ascended through hidden rituals and they came to personify the deities of the modern world.","title":"Secret - Neliavth Society"},{"location":"history/secret_lore/neliavth_society/#neliavth","text":"","title":"Neliavth"},{"location":"history/secret_lore/neliavth_society/#the-ancients-ascended","text":"The Neliavth is the group name for an ancient race (or possibly a collection of variant sub-races), who lived in times before reckoning.

During the Age of Stone , they were heavily influenced by the Dwarven settlers, embracing the progress they brought and feeling kinship with their moral ethos. New settlements form rarely in this land, where most regard nature before riches and many villages stay small. These days, adventurers from all over flock to the uncharted plains. Many also choose to retire in the easy going life of the isolated communities. Lifestyle All Narr have a close relationship with nature and ths is evident in their lifestyle, yet are still very mush at home in urban society. Their love for nature serves as an ethos when dealing with each other and outsiders, which becomes even more evident when they build and expand their settlements. Industry serves progress, but not at the cost of nature. Urbanization brings affluence through trade and knowledge through discourse, but not at the cost of tradition and self worth. Farming, and hunting are seen as noble professions, as it measures the men by the sweat of their brow - a challenging and worthy ideal. People also hunt for sport, as they have for many generations, but care is taken as to not taking too much, leaving the land bare. Settlements Most of the major settlements are quite modernized and civilized, especially those located on key trade routes. But for the most part, the vast expanse of rolling savannah hills are untouched and verdant. Small villages are scattered across the wilderness, where the land shows why it was historically known as the Barbarian Kingdom . Leadership & Nobility Stemming from historical traditions, the Narrenfell is guided (rather than ruled) by a Triad of leaders from the major cities in the region. They are known as Sebi chiefs , who reside in the three capitals of the region: Sceptre's Hall in the West, Port Mere in the South, and Eskold in the North.

During the Age of Stone , they were heavily influenced by the Dwarven settlers, embracing the progress they brought and feeling kinship with their moral ethos. New settlements form rarely in this land, where most regard nature before riches and many villages stay small. These days, adventurers from all over flock to the uncharted plains. Many also choose to retire in the easy going life of the isolated communities.","title":"People of Ni'arnfell"},{"location":"people/by_region/niarnfell/#lifestyle","text":"All Narr have a close relationship with nature and ths is evident in their lifestyle, yet are still very mush at home in urban society. Their love for nature serves as an ethos when dealing with each other and outsiders, which becomes even more evident when they build and expand their settlements. Industry serves progress, but not at the cost of nature. Urbanization brings affluence through trade and knowledge through discourse, but not at the cost of tradition and self worth. Farming, and hunting are seen as noble professions, as it measures the men by the sweat of their brow - a challenging and worthy ideal.

It is a remnant of the same energies that created the universe, limited to some extent as a resource, but foundational to the existence of the cosmos. Some creatures gain special characteristics for just being in the proximity of a Powerful Divine Source. And those who become it's conduit, become true gods. Divine Beings and Rank Divine Outsider: Entities native to the divine realms are the least powerful type of divine being. These include angels, demons and devils native to Aegis, Nox and the Myst realm. Immortals: There are some beings who are born outside of time and bloodlines of the outer planes. These are known as immortals. Though they do not whither by age, they can be killed by other means. They may be born of any plane or realm, but are rare and hard to identify.

The other had skin of gold and a tongue of silver, embodying the essence of Chaos as seen in the realm of Law. The latter child, the Golden Princess, was Callad. Together with her sister, they ascended to rule the shadowy underbelly of the divine, and their influence soon extended to the realm of mortals. Callad was born with a much lighter heart than that of her sibling. She did not crave the same destruction. Rather her Chaos manifested in the opposite, favouring life over death. Her purpose was set on the shifting perceptions of the living and the ability to abuse that which is said to be the truth and that which is law. She spent her divine childhood stalking the halls of the divine and even the mortal realms in a constant search to topple stability. It was not until she happened upon the lair of of Assador , where she was caught stealing. The Dark lord's wrath fell upon her as he lashed out with claw and whip. It is said that her face was scarred so through his punishment, that she took on the mask of the Palled Oath there.","title":"Deity - Callad"},{"location":"religion/deities/callad/#callad","text":"","title":"Callad"},{"location":"religion/deities/callad/#the-goddess-of-thieves-and-treachery","text":"Details Type: Major Deity Alignment: Chaotic Neutral Domains: Darkness, Knowledge, Trickery Symbol: A White, Featureless Mask called \"The Palled Oath\" Followers: Thieves, Assassins, Spies, Merchants and all who trade in subterfuge and secret information.

Without her picturesque features, she would never hold as much passion in the hearts of men. ELmara rose to the challenge, and approached the Mindless Giant \u00c4run to craft a mask for her. The creature was one with the forge and had no other desire than to work his forge, but in the presence of the Lady a sense of recognition came over the giant. He heard her request, and promised to forge for her a mask of emerald, if she promised to visit him every thousand years so that he can experience the clarity of mind to create once more. ELmara vowed to Lilith that she will never again take off the mask, to prove that her followers were not under the influence of her beauty. But it just so happened that \u00c4run the giant, with his mind restored, had created the most magical of artifacts, enhancing the goddess's beauty ten fold.

As such they all tend to revere the Erigrim as divine ancestors regardless of their other religious beliefs. The pantheon is considered a union, as all Dwarves are kin no matter from which clan or country they originate. It is therefore common for Dwarves to consider all of them equally, even when choosing a single Kazmukzak\u00e4l (god-elder) as their clan Paragon. As for Durathor, it is rare for a Dwarf to consider him a direct patron, as his worship is generally considered in contrast to the Dwarven morality. Reverence of him is reserved for the denizens of the Reilagg - Ash-skinned Gray Dwarves and their Corrupted kin. He is however regarded as one of the Kazmukzak\u00e4llen (god-elders) and respect is given to his name. It is particularly useful to his name to scare would be troublemakers, including naughty children as a warning of what is to come of those who disregard their honour and duty. Myths & Dogma Genesis At the dawn of time all Dwarves revered the Old Ones . It was a primal faith that demanded blood sacrifice and intense servitude. The Old ones, though not evil were primal beings, their first priorities being with themselves and not with mortals. In this ancient time, the Dwarves were tribal and lacked the structure of a united society. Agamor was a religious peacekeeper of this time, an appointed Vigilant. His duty was to settle inter-clan disputes to limit the bloodshed of Dwarf-kind. This position made him without clan, with him forsaking all ownership to the clan he once knew, so that his decisions could be without prejudice. It was he who first saw that most clans are alike. Their disagreements were petty, mostly due to the different interpretations of blood price for the Old Ones. Being devout himself he took a pilgrimage to the mountain where their Old Ones lived, a forbidden place to his faith. He wanted to talk to his gods and try to bring peace to his race. Upon reaching the summit he was shocked at what he found. No gods were there to greet him. He saw the wreckage of their living, ruins and corpses, but nothing alive. There at the centre of the ruins he found the Thorgen , the Yurrir , the Runestone . He went down to his people and told them the gods were no longer with them. The clans were in turmoil and soon open battle raged between some. Agamor no longer settled their disputes but was driven to melancholy over the reaction of his people. He decided to further investigate his findings on the mountain, so he gathered his closest friends. With him went Toreval , the collective clan historian; Fallarn , a noble lad of a dwarf, charismatic and strong; Noragall , the brother of Agamor who shared his love for their people; and Oriess, a chief miner of his clan. They later became the first of the Erigrim , the Elders , the Eternal Ones . They were not the only of the people to follow the path to divinity, but they were the first to start. From the mountain summit Agamor watched his people. His party explored the ruins of their once revered gods, trying to find some clue to their disappearance. But it was not long before they came. They came to see why their offerings had stopped. Shadows overcast the summit as they came. First to arrive was a manifestation of Air, the titan they once called Validarn . It cut them with its sharp wings in anger at their betrayal. Agamor and his friends had to take cover inside the ruined structures to get away from Validarn . Inside they were met by a manifestation of darkness, the titan they once called Valigath . It blinded them completely and made them choke on its poison. Agamor and his friends ran once again, to the centre of the ruins. There, with his ceremonial Warhammer, Agamor struck the Runestone. No one knows why he went for it. Maybe he felt it pull his arm. Maybe he wanted to destroy it to curse the Old ones. It struck like thunder across the skies, light pouring from the Runestone into a beam that divided clouds. Validarn and Valigath was driven back by its light. The pedestal upon which the Runestone lay crumbled, but the stone itself remained floating in the air, shining with brilliant light. Agamor grabbed the stone and he fled with his friends from the summit. And so the war between the Dwarves and the Old Ones started, yet it was a battle doomed from the start. Fallarn , the embodiment of Dwarven bravery called the clans together and convinced them to fight. Noragall strengthened their bond of unity, making them remember their honour and pride. All the clans gathered to fight against the immortals. Their fiercest general, Gort came forward to lead the assault. The Dwarves used the Runestone every time they went into battle, striking it to weaken the Old Ones. Many died still and the Dwarves were losing the war. Toreval was first to suggest that the markings on the Runestone was more than decorations. He thought it was a text, written in the language of the Old Ones and that it gave the stone its power. This is when Agamor's study began. The Dwarves were losing so many warriors, they started to fragment. Out of the stone and rock they carved sanctuaries to hide from the wrath of the Old Ones. Sanctuaries turned to fortresses and the dwarves found that they could hold out and survive underground. New heroes were born and old ones died. Urir the Assassin, Bazardin the Smith. Still Agamor studied the Runestone and still more were lost to the war. The stone kept those close to it alive and it kept Agamor and his allies from aging. It was in the 400 th year since the stone was found that the Erigrim became more than the leaders of the war. The clans saw them as living paragons of their unity, respecting and even fearing them as demigods. It took them 684 years to unravel the mysteries of the Runestone. In this time the face of the eternal war changed many times. From the Old Ones were spawned creatures of darkness that plagued the lands. Dragons were commanded by ancient pacts and powerful magic, to rain down fire over crops. It was the Age of Chaos by the standard of the Eternal Forge . By then the Dwarves were settled underground. Between skirmishes fought against the Old Ones, new enemies came from the deep caverns. It was a time when the Dwarves were few, and most of any hope was lost. But the translation of the stone brought magic into the hands of the Dwarves. It made them immensely powerful. They forged weapons that could kill gods and hope was sparkled once again. Historians called it the Age of Stone . The Dwarves drove back the Old Ones and lifted the curse of 700 years. The Dwarves built an empire across the known world as have never been seen before. The Dwarves grew ambitious and proud. It was in this time that the Erigrim reached true divinity, but only after another disaster struck. Some say it was a final attempt of the Old Ones to settle the score with the Dwarves, although no one had seen a manifestation for hundreds of years. Others again believe it to be the dragons, who hated all mortals, who called forth the corruption. All that is certain is that the Dwarves delved so deep into the earth that they opened a gateway to a dark and evil place, the Reilagg . Devils spawned from this darkness and fought against the Dwarves from below. These creatures were difficult to kill and they could strike at the heart of the Dwarven strongholds. With them came The Corruption , silent whispers in the minds of leaders that drove them to turn on each other. Many was driven mad. Desperate and overtaken by greed, Oreiss planned to steal the Runestone that gave them their power and pawn it to the gods of the other races. He wanted to trade it for his own immortality, so that he wouldn\u2019t be corrupted and killed by the darkness that infested the I. The price of true divinity, however, held more in store than the greedy Oreiss had anticipated. The Runestone had touched many lives already and their strings of fate were firmly attached to it. It had become part of Dwarven culture, their livelihood and worship. If it were to fall out of Dwarven hands, it would end the whole of Dwarven history. The goddess of Magic, Maia, came up with a solution. She would take the stone into her care, as it was an artefact of magic. This would link the lives it touched to the divine and grant the Erigrim true divinity, but it would also upset the balance of reality. The price of their divinity would have to be balanced with an antithesis to their virtue. This antithesis however needed a vessel, just as the Erigrim who once were mortal. Maia kept the stone on good faith as Oreiss returned to his people and told them what he had done. Oreiss\u2019 betrayal was not well met by most of the Erigrim, but it was Urir the Evenminded and Toreval the Wise who convinced them that Oreiss\u2019 actions, although selfish and ill conceived, granted them an opportunity to save their beloved people. Agamor himself took it upon him to vow eternal vigilance over the Dwarves, and with him at their head they went to meet with the other gods. Here they accepted the responsibility of taking care of the Dwarves. Oreiss\u2019 son volunteered himself to the fate of being the vessel of evil and became the one known as Durathor . With his naming all dwarves who fell victim to the corruption and still lived, turned grey as ash. Their flesh became cold as stone itself and their hearts were forever lost to the bidding of their new god, Durathor . And so it came to be that The Eligrim became gods and Durathor was named. The paragons built Heldar and took the battle to the Reilagg and Durathor himself. It so came to be that the Dwarves could continue their fight and had the time to rebuild their defences. Until this day no Dwarf has forgotten their lost brothers as they fight their war until the day that the Eternal Forge makes them all new.","title":"Deity - The Erigrim"},{"location":"religion/deities/erigrim/#the-erigrim","text":"","title":"The Erigrim"},{"location":"religion/deities/erigrim/#divine-dwarf-ancestors","text":"Details Type: Minor Pantheon culminating to a Major Divine Source.

As such they all tend to revere the Erigrim as divine ancestors regardless of their other religious beliefs. The pantheon is considered a union, as all Dwarves are kin no matter from which clan or country they originate. It is therefore common for Dwarves to consider all of them equally, even when choosing a single Kazmukzak\u00e4l (god-elder) as their clan Paragon. As for Durathor, it is rare for a Dwarf to consider him a direct patron, as his worship is generally considered in contrast to the Dwarven morality. Reverence of him is reserved for the denizens of the Reilagg - Ash-skinned Gray Dwarves and their Corrupted kin. He is however regarded as one of the Kazmukzak\u00e4llen (god-elders) and respect is given to his name.

It was a primal faith that demanded blood sacrifice and intense servitude. The Old ones, though not evil were primal beings, their first priorities being with themselves and not with mortals. In this ancient time, the Dwarves were tribal and lacked the structure of a united society. Agamor was a religious peacekeeper of this time, an appointed Vigilant. His duty was to settle inter-clan disputes to limit the bloodshed of Dwarf-kind. This position made him without clan, with him forsaking all ownership to the clan he once knew, so that his decisions could be without prejudice. It was he who first saw that most clans are alike. Their disagreements were petty, mostly due to the different interpretations of blood price for the Old Ones. Being devout himself he took a pilgrimage to the mountain where their Old Ones lived, a forbidden place to his faith. He wanted to talk to his gods and try to bring peace to his race. Upon reaching the summit he was shocked at what he found. No gods were there to greet him. He saw the wreckage of their living, ruins and corpses, but nothing alive. There at the centre of the ruins he found the Thorgen , the Yurrir , the Runestone . He went down to his people and told them the gods were no longer with them. The clans were in turmoil and soon open battle raged between some. Agamor no longer settled their disputes but was driven to melancholy over the reaction of his people. He decided to further investigate his findings on the mountain, so he gathered his closest friends. With him went Toreval , the collective clan historian; Fallarn , a noble lad of a dwarf, charismatic and strong; Noragall , the brother of Agamor who shared his love for their people; and Oriess, a chief miner of his clan. They later became the first of the Erigrim , the Elders , the Eternal Ones . They were not the only of the people to follow the path to divinity, but they were the first to start. From the mountain summit Agamor watched his people. His party explored the ruins of their once revered gods, trying to find some clue to their disappearance. But it was not long before they came. They came to see why their offerings had stopped. Shadows overcast the summit as they came. First to arrive was a manifestation of Air, the titan they once called Validarn . It cut them with its sharp wings in anger at their betrayal. Agamor and his friends had to take cover inside the ruined structures to get away from Validarn . Inside they were met by a manifestation of darkness, the titan they once called Valigath . It blinded them completely and made them choke on its poison. Agamor and his friends ran once again, to the centre of the ruins. There, with his ceremonial Warhammer, Agamor struck the Runestone. No one knows why he went for it. Maybe he felt it pull his arm. Maybe he wanted to destroy it to curse the Old ones. It struck like thunder across the skies, light pouring from the Runestone into a beam that divided clouds. Validarn and Valigath was driven back by its light. The pedestal upon which the Runestone lay crumbled, but the stone itself remained floating in the air, shining with brilliant light. Agamor grabbed the stone and he fled with his friends from the summit. And so the war between the Dwarves and the Old Ones started, yet it was a battle doomed from the start. Fallarn , the embodiment of Dwarven bravery called the clans together and convinced them to fight. Noragall strengthened their bond of unity, making them remember their honour and pride. All the clans gathered to fight against the immortals. Their fiercest general, Gort came forward to lead the assault. The Dwarves used the Runestone every time they went into battle, striking it to weaken the Old Ones. Many died still and the Dwarves were losing the war. Toreval was first to suggest that the markings on the Runestone was more than decorations. He thought it was a text, written in the language of the Old Ones and that it gave the stone its power. This is when Agamor's study began. The Dwarves were losing so many warriors, they started to fragment. Out of the stone and rock they carved sanctuaries to hide from the wrath of the Old Ones. Sanctuaries turned to fortresses and the dwarves found that they could hold out and survive underground. New heroes were born and old ones died. Urir the Assassin, Bazardin the Smith. Still Agamor studied the Runestone and still more were lost to the war. The stone kept those close to it alive and it kept Agamor and his allies from aging. It was in the 400 th year since the stone was found that the Erigrim became more than the leaders of the war. The clans saw them as living paragons of their unity, respecting and even fearing them as demigods. It took them 684 years to unravel the mysteries of the Runestone. In this time the face of the eternal war changed many times. From the Old Ones were spawned creatures of darkness that plagued the lands. Dragons were commanded by ancient pacts and powerful magic, to rain down fire over crops. It was the Age of Chaos by the standard of the Eternal Forge . By then the Dwarves were settled underground. Between skirmishes fought against the Old Ones, new enemies came from the deep caverns. It was a time when the Dwarves were few, and most of any hope was lost. But the translation of the stone brought magic into the hands of the Dwarves. It made them immensely powerful. They forged weapons that could kill gods and hope was sparkled once again. Historians called it the Age of Stone . The Dwarves drove back the Old Ones and lifted the curse of 700 years. The Dwarves built an empire across the known world as have never been seen before. The Dwarves grew ambitious and proud. It was in this time that the Erigrim reached true divinity, but only after another disaster struck. Some say it was a final attempt of the Old Ones to settle the score with the Dwarves, although no one had seen a manifestation for hundreds of years. Others again believe it to be the dragons, who hated all mortals, who called forth the corruption. All that is certain is that the Dwarves delved so deep into the earth that they opened a gateway to a dark and evil place, the Reilagg . Devils spawned from this darkness and fought against the Dwarves from below. These creatures were difficult to kill and they could strike at the heart of the Dwarven strongholds. With them came The Corruption , silent whispers in the minds of leaders that drove them to turn on each other. Many was driven mad. Desperate and overtaken by greed, Oreiss planned to steal the Runestone that gave them their power and pawn it to the gods of the other races. He wanted to trade it for his own immortality, so that he wouldn\u2019t be corrupted and killed by the darkness that infested the I. The price of true divinity, however, held more in store than the greedy Oreiss had anticipated. The Runestone had touched many lives already and their strings of fate were firmly attached to it. It had become part of Dwarven culture, their livelihood and worship. If it were to fall out of Dwarven hands, it would end the whole of Dwarven history. The goddess of Magic, Maia, came up with a solution. She would take the stone into her care, as it was an artefact of magic. This would link the lives it touched to the divine and grant the Erigrim true divinity, but it would also upset the balance of reality. The price of their divinity would have to be balanced with an antithesis to their virtue. This antithesis however needed a vessel, just as the Erigrim who once were mortal. Maia kept the stone on good faith as Oreiss returned to his people and told them what he had done. Oreiss\u2019 betrayal was not well met by most of the Erigrim, but it was Urir the Evenminded and Toreval the Wise who convinced them that Oreiss\u2019 actions, although selfish and ill conceived, granted them an opportunity to save their beloved people. Agamor himself took it upon him to vow eternal vigilance over the Dwarves, and with him at their head they went to meet with the other gods. Here they accepted the responsibility of taking care of the Dwarves. Oreiss\u2019 son volunteered himself to the fate of being the vessel of evil and became the one known as Durathor . With his naming all dwarves who fell victim to the corruption and still lived, turned grey as ash. Their flesh became cold as stone itself and their hearts were forever lost to the bidding of their new god, Durathor . And so it came to be that The Eligrim became gods and Durathor was named. The paragons built Heldar and took the battle to the Reilagg and Durathor himself. It so came to be that the Dwarves could continue their fight and had the time to rebuild their defences. Until this day no Dwarf has forgotten their lost brothers as they fight their war until the day that the Eternal Forge makes them all new.","title":"Genesis"},{"location":"religion/deities/erthan/","text":"Erthan The god of Farming, Life-cycles, Crops and Weather Details Type: Major Deity Alignment: Neutral Good Domains: Life, Light, Nature Symbol: A simple, almost geometrically styled grain of wheat in gold.

It is said that she was birthed from a union of the Morning Lord and Lady Elmara during this time. As a child goddess, she played amongst the ruins of battle and learned to know the world as an unjust and cruel place. As she grew, she asked her father why the world was so unjust. \"For in a world of the unjust, there are good men doing nothing\" , the Morning Lord replied. She asked her mother, then, why the people of the world did nothing against the evils of the day. \"For there are no one to stand and lead them\" , the Lady said with a sigh. Heron grew strong during those days. Ever more being met with the bitterness of the living realms. Ever more seeing the destruction her fellow divine caused upon the world. With her growing strength, came the realization that she herself could be the banner bearer for the unavenged. She could be the one who leads the fight against the unjust. And so the goddess was born into true divinity, when she picked up the mantel of protecting the weak. She brought retribution to those who defiled the virtues of honour, brought valor to the hearts of men and brought down the hand of poetic retribution against those who oppressed the weak.","title":"Genesis"},{"location":"religion/deities/hhoru/","text":"Hhoru God of Blood, Sacrifice and Spirits of Nature Details Type: Major Deity Alignment: Neutral Evil Domains: Grave, Nature, Twilight Symbol: The Moontongue Death rune, drawn in Blood Followers: Shaman, Barbarians, Cannibals, Death worshippers, Evil Fey, Evil Elves.

Myths & Dogma Genesis Before the ages of mortals, when the cosmos was still young and titans roamed the lands of Aklatoria, Gaia gave birth to her first daughters. Among these entities was the first maiden, named Lilith. Her being was not of the divine, but of the essence of nature itself, immortal and changing. She was one with the earth and its creatures and cared for them as a mother would care for her children. Through the eons before counting, Lilith grew more beautiful by the year. She met with other entities, including the divine on a regular basis, and her beauty enticed them to grant her favours and blessings. She grew to appreciate the attention her beauty brought her. As the world evolved through its pre-historic ages, Lilith grew excited at the progress of it. But suddenly and out of nowhere, all her subjects mysteriously disappeared from the face of Aklatoria. It was a time know as The Vanishing . She searched the realms for a reason for The Vanishing but could find none. Instead, she found that in the wake of The Vanishing , mysterious orbs of power was left behind on Aklatoria. It was the beginning of the Age of Seeding , and the dawn of the gods. Lilith followed one such orb, the Seed of the River to where if fell on the plains. She drank in its essence and was born anew as a true divine being. The Contest between Lilith and Elmara Not long after ascending to divinity, Lilith met her match in beauty. Her rival was Elmara , the goddess of diplomacy and nobility. Where Elmara's beauty was elegant and graceful, Lilith's was primal and infatuating. Lilith saw that Elmara had many followers among the mortals already, and saw that they were as infatuated with Elmara as they were with herself. She told Elmara that the true power over the mortal realm was through their intoxicating beauty, and not through their actions or words. Lilith understood the primal nature of the creatures of the earth, for she lived among them for eons. Elmara was not convinced, however, so Lilith challenged her to cover her face in a mask for the next generation of mortals, to see if she still held the same sway over them. Elmara accepted the challenge and enlisted the services of a mad giant \u00c4run to create the mask. The creature was driven mad when he created the Dwarven race, overextending his powers. Through some fluke, however, the Giant was able to create for Elmara a powerful emerald mask that magically enhanced her beauty even more. Lilith was shocked at the outcome and wished for \u00c4run to do the same for her, but the giant was back to his mindless self and could not comply. The rival goddesses decided that their competition was over. Each application of their beauty had merits. Elmara would use hers to entice change in the hearts of the mortals, and Lilith chose that hers would be used to enflame their passions. The Birth of Manos Claye During the early ages in the time of the God Wars , Ura proposed to Lilith that she bare him a son. He wanted to teach his offspring to control the fires, in order to make the perfect smith and therefore the perfect aid against the onslaughts of the God Wars. Lilith agreed to the arrangement, but secretly approached the other gods for blessing of her own devising to be places upon the child. From Lafarn she asked a blessing of independence so that the child can follow his own path, away from his father. From Na\u00e1sh Feramil she asked for a blessing of compassion so that he will not only use his abilities for destruction. And from Opus she asked that he bless her son with an understanding of the natural order and knowledge of minerals and stones so that his crafts can be more than mere tools, but works of art formed through an innate understanding of the source. And so son of Ura and Lilith was born. She named him Manos Claye and he became the Master of the Forge.","title":"Deity - Lilith"},{"location":"religion/deities/lilith/#lilith","text":"","title":"Lilith"},{"location":"religion/deities/lilith/#the-goddess-of-beauty-seduction-and-passion","text":"Details Type: Major Deity Alignment: Chaotic Neutral Domains: Beauty, Love, Trickery Symbol: An Eight pointed star inside a circle Followers: The Lovelorn, Enticed, Passionate, Hedonists, Prostitutes and all who value power that beauty brings.

And from Opus she asked that he bless her son with an understanding of the natural order and knowledge of minerals and stones so that his crafts can be more than mere tools, but works of art formed through an innate understanding of the source. And so son of Ura and Lilith was born.

The act had caused the Giant his mind and he was therefore unable to create what the gods truly needed.

Followers: Shaman, Cultists, Vampires, Death worshippers, Exterminators. Nahua's primary form is that of vermin. A slight manifestation might be seen in the form of a swarm of rats or locusts. The more his presence manifests the more the swarm takes shape, until he becomes a shifting, giant, bipedal creature animated through and endless swarm of vermin. Associated Religious Organizations Order of the Grotto (Primary Cult of Nahua) Common Worship There are many who believe that the only way to ensure good crop and prosperity, a tribute should be given to the god of famine and pestilence. They offer up a portion of their yield at the altar of Nahua to appease him and his vermin and have them stay away from their lands. But more commonly, Nahua is regarded with fear and is to be avoided. Vermin is seen as his foothold on the land, his eyes and ears in the realms of mortals.The creatures are killed and eradicated in fear that the god of Disaster gain too much power in their lands and is able to summon forth true disaster. Myths & Dogma Genesis Before the age of gods, many powerful spirits roamed the lands. These creatures dominated the mortal races into worshipping them and by their primal natures they were able to harness this worship to some extent. Nahua was among these entities in that time, a shape shifter and beast-speaker with the ability to talk to vermin. He used this ability to threaten the ancient mortals with plague and pestilence. As the ages progressed Nahua became one with the creatures of his will. To some extent he cared for them and they for him. He grew tired of the company of the other spirits and pestering the mortals gave him no more pleasure. It was then when he turned toward the deep underground, looking for new sport to entertain him in his immortality. The unknown deep was vast and silent in those times, and soon Nahua began to fear that he would forever be lost in the caverns below. As he was about to give up all hope, he found a chamber in the lost caverns. Inside it was a darkness seeping through the vail between planes. Tendrils of death reached out to him from the vortex and the Spirit recoiled. But his curiosity drove him back again, stepping closer to the dark embrace of the Void. Nahua called on his vermin to flood the chamber and feed the tendrils of death. Day by day he moved closer to the vortex, continuously running scores of his pets into it. After many days he was close enough to feel the essence of whatever lied beyond flow over him. His mind filled with images and primal memories from the times before creation. It is unknown how long Nahua sat there, feeding the vortex and bathing in it's darkness. After a while he himself was unsure if his mind was still his own. When he emerged from the deep the world had changed. The land and peoples reformed to something new. Gods were born and Nahua saw war and suffering everywhere his eyes fell. He did not know how long he was caught in the Deep, but when he looked upon the destruction, he was filled with a maddening pleasure. He could feel the world at his feet as if everything around him was connected to his will. He was made new in the Deep, bu the tendrils of the void. He was ascended. The first Vampire It is told that long ago there lived a noble lord in a land which name has been lost to the ages. He was kind and beloved by his people, intelligent and successful in his conquests. The lord is said to be one of Caine, a line that is no more. The lord had a beautiful wife, told to have been blessed by both Lilith in her beauty and Heron in her strength. But through a curse from one of his rivals, the Lady was stricken with an incurable disease that had her rot away before his eyes. The lord spared no expense, summoning healers and sages from all the world to help him save his wife. As all hope was lost, the Lord found it again with the Order of the Grotto . He was approached by one of the sect's most powerful clerics, who hinted at the powers the Rat god gained by reaching to the Deep Void. Out of options and drained from years of desperation, the Lord Caine ventured with the cleric to the sanctum of Nahua, where he was allowed to study the dark ceremonies and secret tomes in search of a cure. The price was his own life, as dictated by the Order. But the lord was on the verge of madness already, and as he studied the secrets before him he was consumed by the presence of Nahua. He found the scriptures he needed, but only after years of maddened seeking and no way of knowing that his wife had long since passed. Without hesitation the Lord performed the darkest of rituals in the inner sanctum of Nahua. His soul was ripped from his body in an awful transformation. He became filled with the bloodlust of the damned as his soul was replaced with a piece of Nahua's essence. The lord rushed back to his beloved. When he realized that she was no longer alive, and that he was lost in his mad search for years, he was overcome with a blind rage.

These creatures dominated the mortal races into worshipping them and by their primal natures they were able to harness this worship to some extent. Nahua was among these entities in that time, a shape shifter and beast-speaker with the ability to talk to vermin. He used this ability to threaten the ancient mortals with plague and pestilence. As the ages progressed Nahua became one with the creatures of his will. To some extent he cared for them and they for him. He grew tired of the company of the other spirits and pestering the mortals gave him no more pleasure. It was then when he turned toward the deep underground, looking for new sport to entertain him in his immortality. The unknown deep was vast and silent in those times, and soon Nahua began to fear that he would forever be lost in the caverns below. As he was about to give up all hope, he found a chamber in the lost caverns. Inside it was a darkness seeping through the vail between planes. Tendrils of death reached out to him from the vortex and the Spirit recoiled. But his curiosity drove him back again, stepping closer to the dark embrace of the Void. Nahua called on his vermin to flood the chamber and feed the tendrils of death. Day by day he moved closer to the vortex, continuously running scores of his pets into it. After many days he was close enough to feel the essence of whatever lied beyond flow over him. His mind filled with images and primal memories from the times before creation. It is unknown how long Nahua sat there, feeding the vortex and bathing in it's darkness. After a while he himself was unsure if his mind was still his own. When he emerged from the deep the world had changed. The land and peoples reformed to something new. Gods were born and Nahua saw war and suffering everywhere his eyes fell. He did not know how long he was caught in the Deep, but when he looked upon the destruction, he was filled with a maddening pleasure. He could feel the world at his feet as if everything around him was connected to his will. He was made new in the Deep, bu the tendrils of the void. He was ascended.","title":"Genesis"},{"location":"religion/deities/nahua/#the-first-vampire","text":"It is told that long ago there lived a noble lord in a land which name has been lost to the ages. He was kind and beloved by his people, intelligent and successful in his conquests. The lord is said to be one of Caine, a line that is no more. The lord had a beautiful wife, told to have been blessed by both Lilith in her beauty and Heron in her strength. But through a curse from one of his rivals, the Lady was stricken with an incurable disease that had her rot away before his eyes. The lord spared no expense, summoning healers and sages from all the world to help him save his wife. As all hope was lost, the Lord found it again with the Order of the Grotto . He was approached by one of the sect's most powerful clerics, who hinted at the powers the Rat god gained by reaching to the Deep Void. Out of options and drained from years of desperation, the Lord Caine ventured with the cleric to the sanctum of Nahua, where he was allowed to study the dark ceremonies and secret tomes in search of a cure. The price was his own life, as dictated by the Order. But the lord was on the verge of madness already, and as he studied the secrets before him he was consumed by the presence of Nahua. He found the scriptures he needed, but only after years of maddened seeking and no way of knowing that his wife had long since passed. Without hesitation the Lord performed the darkest of rituals in the inner sanctum of Nahua. His soul was ripped from his body in an awful transformation. He became filled with the bloodlust of the damned as his soul was replaced with a piece of Nahua's essence. The lord rushed back to his beloved. When he realized that she was no longer alive, and that he was lost in his mad search for years, he was overcome with a blind rage. Within minutes the damned lord slaughtered all his subjects, ripping out their throats with his teeth and clawing out their hearts. He burst forth in a swarm of bats and rushed across his kingdom.

Myths & Dogma Genesis Before the ages of reckoning, Strider was born an immortal spirit of the heavens, with the power of possession. Although at the time he was not truly divine, he had within him the powers of determination and could often twist fate ever so slightly in his favour. But the day he became divine was one of note, as even his own twists and schemes were put to the test. He was hailed by all the divines for his exceptional luck and even amongst the gods he was considered almost untouchable. It was the divine Lex Fireheart who challenged him to a duel of fate. Stryder would possess one lesser creature and try to avoid the destructive powers of the gods one by one. If his vessel were to survive, Strider would be granted divinity himself. None of the divine believed that Stryder would be able to survive their onslaught, but designated five of their strongest to devise the challenges. Strider, as per his usual whimsy chose to possess the first creature he saw, which happened to be a tiny fox. Leonne was first and chose to call forth a great hunter to catch the little fox. She turned herself into a giant tiger and gave chase. But the little fox was quick as well, and with a little bit of luck on his side, managed to crawl into a tiny hole, to small for the tiger to fit into. After an hour of frantic roaring and clawing at the earth, the gods agreed that the first challenge was passed. Next they chose [Ornim]../ornim), for he would be able to use the earth itself to crush the fox inside his hole. But the crafty fox had anticipated such a move and had long since found another way out of his hiding spot. As the earth started to shake, the little fox was looking down from the branches of a great oak, free from the destructive trembles. When Ornim finally realized that the little fox wasn't in the hole any more, enough time had passed that the second challenge was deemed a pass. The third challenger was Armara , who saw the crafty fox in the tree, and called for a great owl to grab it from it's perch. With a little bit of luck, Stryder leapt from the branch just as the owl swooped in and was able to escape. He fell between the long grass below, where the owl could not see him, and Armara halted her pursuit as she was starting to root for the little fox herself. The fall had knocked the wind from Stryder's vessel, and as the fox limped from the grass, Tor called forth a loud flash from the heavens as the fourth challenge. Lighting arched through the sky and ran over the fox's body, scorching his fur. But the god of Storms had sprung his trap too soon, before the clouds had properly formed above. Strider was not killed by the blow, but its little body wus flung out into a lake. The cool water extinguished the flames on the little fox's body and kept him alive long enough to get back his senses. As luck would have it, he was able to submerge himself underwater as the next lightning strikes came, for foxes are excellent swimmers. Strike after strike fell to the earth surrounding the lake, dispersing across the water where it struck. The fourth challenge was won. By this time Lex Fireheart had seen enough of Stryder's spirit. He admired his determination and bravery for taking on the challenge of the gods. But he didn't want to diminish Stryder's will by giving him an easy challenge. He decided to truly test the creature's luck, not by using his might and martial skills, but instead to let fate decide his destiny. Also a shape-shifter, Lex turned himself into a fox as well and jumped into the water next to Stryder. At first everyone was confused, but then saw what the Brave One had seen. The storm had roused the giant crocodiles of the lake and they were closing in on the pair. The two foxes scrambled to get out of the water as soon as they could, the crocodiles giving chase. Side by side they swam to shore, their deaths closing in fast. Stryder saw that they both would meet their demise, not knowing the fox next to him was an immortal divine. With all his remaining strength he called forth the last of his luck. Next to the lake, the great oak, now struck bu lightning and burning, dropped one of its blazing limbs into the water. The water sizzled to steam and created a large wave running over the surface of the lake. The wave hit the side of the lake where a bank had formed, and the washing caused some of the muddied rocks to slide down into the water. The mudslide grew as the bank cracked and broke, and a great mound slid down between the two foxes and the crocodiles. All who witnessed stood in awe at the amazing circumstance. The fifth challenge was won, and Stryder was granted his reward of becoming one of the divine, as surely his determination and supernatural luck had made him worthy enough.","title":"Deity - Stryder"},{"location":"religion/deities/stryder/#stryder","text":"","title":"Stryder"},{"location":"religion/deities/stryder/#the-god-of-mischief-illusion-intelligence-and-luck","text":"Details Type: Major Deity Alignment: Chaotic Good Domains: Arcana, Trickery Symbol: A depiction of an Open Mouth, its Tongue protruding outward and encircling it.

Over the eons her essence seeped through the vail between the plains, manifesting in the coldest places of Aklatoria. When she finally suppressed her apathy, she saw mortal creatures within the tundras of the world, sparking pity in her - a feeling she though she had long ago forgotten. What she saw were the early Elvin kindred - also banished to the icy planes of the world, chased by war and hated for their fiery passions. It was in the early years of the Age of Stars when she returned to fulfil her divine duties, but this time not as the embodiment of community and prosperity. Her sense of community was replaced by that of survival above all odds. Her sense of prosperity was replaced with blind ambition. And still her wrath remained, as her body imbued with the elemental plain of ice, became a vessel for the icy destruction it can bring.","title":"Deity - Vonryl Kethalon"},{"location":"religion/deities/vonryl_kethalon/#vonryl-kethalon","text":"","title":"Vonryl Kethalon"},{"location":"religion/deities/vonryl_kethalon/#the-goddess-of-eternal-winter","text":"Details Type: Major Deity Alignment: Lawful Evil Domains: Ambition, Protection, Tempest Symbol: A crystalline, jagged star, shaped like a snow flake.

When she finally suppressed her apathy, she saw mortal creatures within the tundras of the world, sparking pity in her - a feeling she though she had long ago forgotten. What she saw were the early Elvin kindred - also banished to the icy planes of the world, chased by war and hated for their fiery passions. It was in the early years of the Age of Stars when she returned to fulfil her divine duties, but this time not as the embodiment of community and prosperity. Her sense of community was replaced by that of survival above all odds. Her sense of prosperity was replaced with blind ambition. And still her wrath remained, as her body imbued with the elemental plain of ice, became a vessel for the icy destruction it can bring.","title":"Genesis"},{"location":"religion/deities/zarach/","text":"Zarach The god of Death and Lost Souls Details Type: Major Deity Alignment: Lawful Evil Domains: Arcana, Darkness, Death Symbol: A Cracked, Humanoid Skull with an Obsidian Gem lodged in the forehead.

Its followers are typically scholars of the Arcane or at least practitioners of magic. It is said that Maia, goddess of Magic elected to call the Circle together in order to better control the use and rules governing the cosmos, including specifically the realm of Myst, Places of Power, Artifacts of magic and the Creatures spawned by it. The Circle gathers in the Crystal Palace, on the plane of Myst in order to decide on the outcomes of many magical related situations. They guide their followers through visions and gifts of magic in order to achieve a balance in the cosmos. Priesthood: Clerics of the Arcane Circle follow the tenants of Balance over anything. They might consider a single patron theirs, or worship all as a pantheon, but that which exceeds even the whims and wills of the gods is the super-divine rule that all power needs to be balanced in order for the universe to survive. Every action has an appropriate and opposite reaction. Being able to restore the balance of magic in some place or form is an ultimate act of faith in the order. Such accomplishments are considered Deeds of Correction, and is celebrated amongst the followers of the faith.

But hierarchy and the law of balance plays a pivotal role in the beliefs of the faithful, as the balance of the cosmos is the responsibility of the goddess. Their chapels are libraries, open to all with the skill to use them. Though care is taken so that balance can be maintained and forbidden powers not be unleashed upon the world. Priesthood: Clergy of Maia are seekers of truth and knowledge, specifically that of an arcane nature. As part of the initiation, followers are to complete a grueling trial of the mind called the Rite of Myst . The trial reveals which branch of the clergy the follower is initiated to. The Three Branches of the Arcanum Staff The Scribes of Neverium are those who search for magical scripts and keep a record of the arcane histories. Their name is derived from the first organized order of Maia. The Staffs of Aegis are those who use magic to enforce the will of the cosmos. Their name is derived from the silver moon of Aegis, the realm of order. The Eyes of the Ever-realms are those who revel in the mysteries of the Myst and its ever-changing nature. The name is derived from the Church\u2019s title for the realm of Myst. Beliefs and Dogma Even among the uninitiated, it is known that Maia was once a mere mortal, of an ancient, long-extinct race that lived before mortals were able to tame the Myst and wield magic as a tool. As a seeker of knowledge, she gained divinity by binding herself to the Myst realm and being a conduit for mortals to channel its power to the material realm. To the clergy, their goddess is not a mere entity or patron overseeing the magic of the world. To them, she is the embodiment of magic and the primary conduit of all magic. By becoming The Conduit, she gained absolute power and the clergy believes she is probably the most powerful of all known deities. Maia is strongly tied to the World Trees . These sites are the anchors that tie the Ever-realms to the world and the primary channel of magical energy into the material plain. The clergy believes that at each of these sites, a physical embodiment of Maia can be found, where she is chained to its magic by unbreakable chains of parchment.

Once an initiate\u2019s worth is proven, she gains a magical mark on her skin. Its form cannot be chosen and is made by undergoing a secret ritual. Clerics wear these with pride. Although denied by the church, it is said that the more elaborate the mark, the more favor the cleric will enjoy from the goddess. Star-bound. The first rank of leadership is in the form of a silver star, worn in some form on the cleric\u2019s clothing. Star-bound have authority over others of lower rank and may contest decisions made by the leaders of a shrine. They, however, have no final claim on the outcomes of individual decisions but are always heard. Star-bound may be shrine leaders themselves should they choose to settle. Robed. The Robed are known by the clerical robes they wear, akin to the depictions of the goddess herself. They serve as inquisitors to the church and have the authority to overrule individual shrine decisions but doing so only in extreme circumstances. Almost all shrines have one Robed as an advisor. Myst-touched. Clerics who achieve great deeds of renown and glory for the church are often promoted to Myst-touched.

Based on their choice the cleric is marked with the rune of his patron or patrons. The only exception is that of Durathor . No honorable Dwarf will openly choose the Gray god as their patron.

They are the Vigilant that guard against the withering on life and the instillers of renewal across the realms. Those who follow the goddess follow the way of healing, by herb, potion, spell or skills. Her teachings guide the devout and instill in them the patience and steadfast wisdom, to be able to refine their crafts and cultivate their compassion. Having a verdant genesis, her temples dot the wilderness as beacons of hope and places of refuge. But her followers, like the wind blowing across the heavens, tend to roam as the eagles do. Priesthood: Being initiated into the ranks of the Sentinels, one must be a proven healer. Usually a devout herbalist or spiritual healer would refer apprentices to join the church, as their methods are established over centuries and their wisdom remains a priceless commodity. Initiates are then sent on a pilgrimage to one of the many sky temples of Armara. The journey usually takes a few months, as these temples are built atop the highest mountains and far away form civilization. Through the trials of the trek, the apprentice is tested in mind and body, and only though determination and perseverance do they reach their journey's end. The temple will present their own challenges, each pertaining to the individual. The goddess knows her followers and choose their trials to suit and test the individual on their own merits.

Worshippers: When working together towards a common goal, those who live by the virtues of honour, justice and valor are able to achieve greatness in a dark and chaotic world. They bring order to the entropy of the cosmos and are beacons of shining light in the abyss. Such is the code of the Ordos Valorium, a knighthood, a brother-and-sisterhood, of like-minded individuals who share a common morality through the patrons they choose to associate with. Members of the Order doesn't single out a deity to serve, but rather choose to serve in the commonalities and joined philosophies of all in the pantheon. They associate a key virtue to each, as for their involvement in the lives of those who join the order and are named by their sigil. The Five Constellations of Virtue The Constellation of the Lady is depicted by Elmara, and stands for Prudence . It encourages the Knight to be thoughtful, practical and wise in their dealings. The Constellation of the Mare is depicted by Heron, and stands for Loyalty . It reminds the Knight that they are never alone, but also that they owe one another the benefit of their aid. The Constellation of the Sword is from Lex Fireheart, and stands for Bravery , for all Knights are unflinching in the face of evil. The Constellation of the Dragon is a depiction of Martivir, and stands for Justice . None can escape it, and the Knight is chartered with delivering it where others are unable to do so. The Sigil of the Star is derived from Lord Aster, and stands for Purity , as Knights are required to be clear of conscience when they fight against the evils of this world, so that they can be the guiding light to those around them. Knighthood: Those who choose to enlist in the Ordos Valorium are trained to fight as Paladins of the faith, and receive the blessings of the pantheon. For the first few years they are trained in defence through combat as well as healing, both magical and not. But as they progress in their training, they can choose to become full Knights of the Ordos Valorium by undergoing an Oath ceremony. Common Paladin Oaths of the Order The Order dictates that the virtues of the Five be followed though all times, but the Knight may choose their own Oath as revealed to them through their own prayers and meditations. Mos commonly, the Knights choose to undertake the Oath of Devotion , as its powers and tenants resonate best with that of the Order. But there are a division within the ranks that also take the Oath of Heroism . These knights typically form the vanguards of the crusade. Then there are also a division of knights who choose to take the Oath of the Watchers . Though they are few, their purpose is noble, as they choose to be the guards against the darkness of the Outer Realms, the place from which the darkness originates. Other Oaths have been taken, though they are in the minority. Given the right circumstances there might be a need for many different types of knights, and the Order recognizes this possibility. These cases are rare, however, and for the most part these paladins stand on the fringes of the Order, not really progressing through its ranks. Beliefs and Dogma: Tenants of the Valorous Knight's Code Prudence and Wisdom is a primary virtue of a well mannered Knight. Loyalty is the cornerstone of the brother-and-sisterhood and should be sought above all else. Bravery is paramount and fear is to be cast aside. Purity of heart takes presidents over law.
